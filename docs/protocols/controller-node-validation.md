# Controller–Node validation evidence

English | [中文](controller-node-validation.zh.md)

The public-codec integration suite enters through `crates/node-protocol/tests/protocol.rs`.
`protocol/session.rs`, `worktree.rs`, and `execution.rs` own their fixtures and constraints;
`support.rs` shares framing and assertions, and `framing.rs` owns transport-independent frame tests.
The larger Worktree and execution field tables live in their respective `rejections.rs` submodules.
Receive counterexamples start with independent JSON and manual framing, never the public writer.
Semantic counterexamples also deserialize into invalid typed messages and exercise the writer,
checking the exact same error and empty output.

### Field coverage inventory

Each row identifies the replacement for the old global fixture and all its scanned opaque fields.
Every required table also names `message_type`, `protocol_version` and `payload`. Missing fields
produce `DecodeJson`; empty and whitespace-only strings produce the exact `EmptyField` on both
codec paths. Each baseline is accepted before mutation. Replacement pointers must exist and deletion
must actually remove a field.

Fixed wire fixtures cover all 12 message variants, all six Worktree messages with and without
`request_id`, Unknown/Accepted/Running, Completed with each of the four terminal variants, and
Removed/AlreadyAbsent removal outcomes. Expected JSON uses literal objects, not serialization of
spec or result types. JSON object order is not contractual. Adding messages or fields requires
reviewing the owning business's wire fixtures and explicit field tables; tables do not discover
new schema fields automatically. A migration audit matched all 175 opaque-field occurrences across
the 25 legal fixtures against the former scanner’s coverage, including optional request IDs.

## Validation and limits

Independent wire tests passed on the unchanged implementation alongside the original 17 tests
(20 tests at that stage). After migration and production refactoring, all 24 integration tests pass.
`cargo test -p ora-node-protocol` and
`cargo clippy -p ora-node-protocol --all-targets -- -D warnings` pass.

Repository checks (2026-09-10): `task format`, Rust workspace lint/tests, Tauri lint/tests, and
Desktop E2E lint/tests passed. The initial `task test` stopped on app-shell's transcript context-menu
copy test (`chat-view.test.tsx:2235`, clipboard mock not called). That test passed in isolation and
all 1,317 app-shell tests passed on a full package rerun. The remaining plugin SDK suite also passed;
all components of `task test` were therefore checked, but its initial combined invocation failed.

The suite checks message legality, not every malformed JSON document. Identically shaped create
and remove payloads remain compatible. Constructors and direct Serde conversion still do not
perform semantic validation. JSON serialization failure is not induced because current typed values
have no fallible custom serializer. Arbitrary I/O failures and atomic rollback after partial writes
are not proved by zero-write validation checks; no exhaustive mutation-testing claim is made.

Session binding, negotiated-session version enforcement, dispatch authorization, durable deduplication,
persist-before-side-effect, persist-before-ack, replay and crash recovery remain Node, Controller and
session responsibilities. These tests provide no evidence for them. Protocol logging remains deferred
under `todo-87602f0b`; source TODO coverage is documented separately.
