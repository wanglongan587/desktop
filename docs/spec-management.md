# Specification management

Ora exposes Markdown specifications as a read-only review surface for both a project root and a
task's authoritative workspace. The feature is intentionally independent from the OpenSpec
workflow-session store: workflow state tracks conversational steps, while Spec management indexes
documents already present on disk.

## Targets and configuration

Every operation carries a tagged `SpecTarget`: either a project id or a task id. Task resolution uses
the same cwd as agent sessions, including linked worktrees and project-root tasks. Source overrides
are persisted per project and therefore apply consistently to the main checkout and every worktree.

Ora considers these default candidates:

- OpenSpec: `openspec/specs`, `openspec/changes`
- Superpowers: `docs/superpowers/specs`, `docs/superpowers/plans`, `docs/plans`
- Custom: `specs`, `docs/specs`

Bounded discovery finds Markdown and MDX below controlled `spec`/`specs` directories and workflow
owned `changes`/`plans` directories. It honors Git ignore rules and excludes generated directories.
Explicit enabled sources are enumerated separately with ignore rules disabled. Exact duplicate paths
are merged using the host filesystem's case semantics, and overlapping documents belong to the
deepest enabled source.

The SQLite `project_spec_source_overrides` table stores normalized relative paths, workflow,
visibility, audit timestamps, and soft-delete state. Replacement is atomic. Project aggregate
deletion soft-deletes these rows in the same transaction.

## API and security

The generated `spec` client namespace exposes catalog, read, source resolution, project-source
replacement, and watch operations. Catalog and read never expose absolute roots. The existing
`task.getWorkspace` operation supplies the optional branch and absolute root needed only for the
platform directory picker.

All filesystem operations canonicalize target and selected paths. Reads accept only `.md`/`.mdx`
files that still belong to the current effective catalog, preventing traversal, symlink escape, and
stale-source authorization. Discovery uses Ora's injected bundled ripgrep with the existing 15-second,
8 MiB, and 10,000-result limits and reports truncation.

## Frontend behavior

`WorkspaceReviewLayout` owns the established 900 px resizable right panel and expanded overlay.
Project context offers Specs only; task context offers Changes, Files, and Specs. Specs remains open
when switching compatible contexts and remounts by target key.

The view places read-only content on the left and the grouped source tree on the right. It supports a
200 ms filename/path filter, safe GFM preview, the existing line-numbered Shiki source viewer, manual
refresh, and mounted-only watching. Raw HTML and MDX JSX are not executed, local images are blocked,
and only catalog-member relative Markdown links navigate inside the panel.

Source configuration uses `PlatformAdapter.selectPath({ kind: "directory" })`, preserving the Web
directory-tree picker and Desktop native picker. Remote errors are rendered through the shared
contract error localizer.

## Using Spec management

1. Select a project to review its root checkout, or select a task to review that task's authoritative
   project-root/linked-worktree directory.
2. Open **Specs** from the review controls. Choose a document from the workflow-grouped tree, filter
   by filename/path, and switch between rendered Markdown and line-numbered source when needed.
3. Open the gear dialog to enable or disable default/discovered sources. Use **Add directory** for an
   arbitrary project-relative source, then choose OpenSpec, Superpowers, or a named custom workflow.
4. Save once to atomically apply the source set to the project and all of its worktrees. Missing
   sources remain visible in this dialog so the configuration survives branch differences.

The project root itself cannot be registered as a source: a source must be a contained subdirectory,
which prevents unrelated repository Markdown from being reclassified as specifications. Documents
remain read-only; editing and deletion continue to belong to the user's normal filesystem tools.
