# Task Workspace Files

Desktop's task workspace file feature provides a read-only view of the active
task workspace. It supports directory browsing, bounded text viewing,
filename/content search, line quoting into chat via gutter `+` (click or drag,
or Ctrl/Cmd+Enter on a focused line number), and native file-change
refreshes.

## Ownership and flow

The client sends a task id and, where needed, a workspace-relative path. Tauri
commands ask the Desktop filesystem service to resolve the task's authoritative
working directory and never accept a caller-provided root. `ora-utils` owns
portable path validation and canonical containment checks; `ora-fs` applies them
to workspace roots and owns file bounds, ripgrep execution, and native watching.

The layers remain narrow:

- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/workspace_files.rs` maps filesystem results to
  contract values and preserves typed lifecycle errors across IPC.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands.rs` owns Tauri extraction, task-root
  resolution, and the command/channel boundary.
- `packages/app-shell/src/features/files` owns the file tree, viewer, search UI,
  cache invalidation, and gutter `+` line quotes into the composer. A quote
  stays a compact chip on both sides of send: the prompt carries a backtick
  `path:range` reference (the agent reads the body itself), and chat history
  reads that back into the same chip instead of replaying source. Diff-gutter
  quotes are the exception — they expand to a mini `diff --git` patch because
  the change is not yet on disk. The same
  Files panel hosts the Specs sub-view; see [Specification management](spec-management.md).
  Chat inline artifact links open this panel through `openWorkspaceFile` and a
  `WorkspaceFileRequest` (`path` + `requestId` + optional
  `FileNavigationLocation` fields: line/column/endLine) so a second click on
  the same file still applies. The view strips a task-cwd prefix from absolute
  ACP paths, expands ancestor directories so the tree shows the file, and
  selects the optional line or inclusive start–end range so the viewer can
  highlight and scroll to it. Citation ranges use the same `--quote-tint` wash
  as a pinned quote (including the gutter); search matches keep amber plus
  `<mark>`. A later click outside a citation range dismisses the wash and the
  header `:start-end` label until the next jump. Search matches stay until the
  next result. Gutter `+` and other buttons do not dismiss. A hit outside the
  task cwd is not opened as a
  worktree-relative path (chat leaves those mentions unlinked). Missing files,
  including a path the user deleted after the agent read it, show the
  localized missing-path copy rather than the raw transport error. A new
  chat `requestId` invalidates the Files query for that path so a second
  open re-reads disk instead of keeping cached content. The backend still
  rejects rooted paths. Desktop File Manager reveals the OS-absolute path
  in the system file manager instead of launching Cursor.

## Project checkout files (draft / no task)

When a chat has a selected project but no task yet (blank or draft composer), Files panel Explorer/Search and `@` file mentions resolve against the **project checkout root** instead of a task worktree. The root is the same `resolve_project_cwd` path used for warm sessions and for tasks created in `project_root` mode on first send.

These operations reuse the same `ora-fs` list/search/read bounds and relative-path rules as the task APIs. Live watching uses `watchProject` against the project checkout the same way `watchWorkspace` watches a task worktree. When both `taskId` and `projectId` are present, Files and the composer prefer the task worktree so linked-worktree checkouts stay authoritative.

## Desktop operations

| Operation                | Request                               | Delivery                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `listWorkspaceDirectory` | `taskId`, optional relative `path`    | `list_workspace_directory`      |
| `readWorkspaceFile`      | `taskId`, relative `path`             | `read_workspace_file`           |
| `searchWorkspace`        | task id and bounded search query      | `search_workspace`              |
| `watchWorkspace`         | `taskId`                              | `stream_contract` Tauri channel |
| `listProjectDirectory`   | `projectId`, optional relative `path` | `list_project_directory`        |
| `readProjectFile`        | `projectId`, relative `path`          | `read_project_file`             |
| `searchProject`          | project id and bounded search query   | `search_project`                |
| `watchProject`           | `projectId`                           | `stream_contract` Tauri channel |

All returned paths are slash-separated and relative to the resolved checkout.
`watchWorkspace` and `watchProject` emit `data`, `error`, and `end` frames. Their error
frame uses the shared `{ code, params, requestId }` contract, so the frontend
uses the same decoder as unary commands. A terminal error already queued during
shutdown is emitted as `error` rather than a successful `end`.

## Safety and UI behavior

Workspace roots are resolved from persisted task or project identity. Paths are
validated as relative paths, canonicalized before containment checks, and
bounded before reads or searches. The filesystem service is read-only and
watcher changes are cache-invalidating batches rather than an event log.

The Files panel opens Explorer by default for both task and project review
contexts and keeps Specs as a dedicated read-only sub-view. Search and file
reads are cancellable through the injected contracts client. A mounted
watcher is stopped when the panel is unmounted or its Files scope (task vs
project) changes.

Rust contracts live in `crates/contracts/src/file_system.rs` and export to
`packages/contracts/src/file-system.ts`. The endpoint catalog in
`xtask/src/frontend/namespaces/file_system.rs` marks the watcher as a stream
operation. Regenerate the TypeScript contract package with
`task export-contracts` after changing these Rust types.
