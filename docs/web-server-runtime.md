# Web Server Runtime

`apps/web/server` is Ora's HTTP backend runtime.

## Purpose

- It boots shared structured logging through `ora-logging` and registers the Gitlancer command-logging bridge.
- It exposes health endpoints for process liveness and runtime readiness.
- It serves persisted HTTP operations for Project, Task, Spec sources, Session, Skill, Agent, and Git identity through the shared `ora-backend` composition.
- It provisions task-owned linked worktrees during creation and leaves Git untouched during deletion.
- It streams ACP load replay and prompt updates as bounded NDJSON responses.
- It exposes the best-effort `watchAppEvents` NDJSON stream used to gate the App Shell and invalidate persisted session queries.
- It provides read-only server filesystem listings for the Web platform path picker.
- It provides a task-scoped, read-only workspace explorer with bounded file reads, ripgrep search, and native refresh events.
- It exposes the shared project/task Spec catalog, safe Markdown reads, project-wide source configuration, and mounted-only refresh streams.

## Data root configuration

The web server reads one runtime data root:

- `ORA_DATA_DIR`: root directory for runtime state. Default: `.`, resolved to an absolute path against the process working directory so Git commands running elsewhere still resolve it correctly. A blank value fails startup.

Every other runtime path is derived from it — there is no separate variable for any of them:

- SQLite database: `<ORA_DATA_DIR>/ora.sqlite3`
- Worktree creation root: `<ORA_DATA_DIR>/worktrees`
- Imported skill folders: `<ORA_DATA_DIR>/atoms/skills`
- Log file: `<ORA_DATA_DIR>/logs/ora.log`
- Session history root: `<ORA_DATA_DIR>/sessions`

Two Ora processes must not share one data root. SQLite tolerates it, but session history files are written on a single-writer assumption that only holds within one process. See [ACP Agent Runtime](agent-runtime.md).

Startup asks `ora-backend` to create the required directories, bootstrap the database, apply the active migration catalog, and construct the shared composition before the runtime is marked ready. A SQLite database that cannot be opened, migrated, or pooled fails startup with a typed bootstrap error rather than serving requests from a partially initialized runtime. The server retains direct composition only for the Web-only filesystem services.

## Project and worktree configuration

The web server does not require a bootstrap project. A new database starts with an empty project
catalog, and users add repositories through the project API or Web UI.

The global worktree root is `<ORA_DATA_DIR>/worktrees`. Task creation resolves the project identified
by the request and provisions linked worktrees under `<ORA_DATA_DIR>/worktrees/<full-task-id>`.
Agent session startup instead resolves Task → Worktree → branch name and then asks Git for the
authoritative linked-worktree path, which becomes the ACP session `cwd`. See
[Task Worktrees](task-worktrees.md).

## Bind configuration

- `ORA_HOST`: bind host. Default: `0.0.0.0`
- `ORA_PORT`: bind port. Default: `32578`

When unset, the server binds `0.0.0.0:32578`. An invalid host or port fails startup with a typed bootstrap error rather than falling back to an unexpected listener address.

Logging variables are documented in [Runtime Logging](runtime-logging.md).

## Health endpoints

- `GET /health/live`: confirms that the process is running
- `GET /health/ready`: confirms that application-state bootstrap completed successfully

`/health/ready` does not return success until the runtime finishes constructing its application
state. An empty project catalog is ready for use.

## HTTP API

Route paths come from shared `ora-contracts` path constants, while the generation-only endpoint catalog in `xtask` references those same constants for the generated client entry. Path parameters are camelCase.

### project

- `POST /api/projects`
- `GET /api/projects`
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}`
- `PUT /api/projects/{projectId}`
- `DELETE /api/projects/{projectId}`

### task

- `POST /api/tasks`
- `GET /api/tasks`
- `GET /api/tasks/{taskId}`
- `PUT /api/tasks/{taskId}`
- `DELETE /api/tasks/{taskId}`

### session

- `POST /api/sessions/warm`
- `GET /api/sessions`
- `GET /api/sessions/{sessionId}`
- `POST /api/sessions/{sessionId}/config`
- `POST /api/sessions/{sessionId}/attach`

- `POST /api/sessions/{sessionId}/agent`
- `POST /api/sessions/{sessionId}/history/resume`
- `DELETE /api/sessions/{sessionId}`

### appEvents

- `GET /api/app-events/watch`

The first data frame is `Ready`. The backend broadcasts subsequent invalidations to every active subscriber and does not use the HTTP connection as a browser-page lease. Events are not persisted or replayed, so clients refetch sessions after initial subscription, stream loss, lag, or queue overflow. The Web App Shell separately uses a same-origin Web Lock to ensure only one browser tab mounts normal application work.

### agentRuntime

- `GET /api/agent-runtime/status`

### skill

- `POST /api/skills`
- `GET /api/skills`
- `GET /api/skills/{skillId}`
- `PUT /api/skills/{skillId}`
- `DELETE /api/skills/{skillId}`

### skillImport

- `POST /api/skill-imports`
- `GET /api/skill-imports/{sessionId}`
- `POST /api/skill-imports/{sessionId}/commit`
- `DELETE /api/skill-imports/{sessionId}`

### agent

- `POST /api/agents`
- `GET /api/agents`
- `GET /api/agents/{agentId}`
- `PUT /api/agents/{agentId}`
- `DELETE /api/agents/{agentId}`

### fileSystem

- `GET /api/file-system/directory?path={absolute_path}`
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/branches`

### task workspace files

- `GET /api/tasks/{taskId}/workspace` returns the authoritative root and optional Git branch used by task-scoped directory selection.
- `POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/files/list` with `{ "path": "src" }` to list one workspace-relative directory
- `POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/files/read` with `{ "path": "src/main.rs" }` to read one bounded UTF-8 file
- `POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/files/search` with `{ "query": "needle", "kind": "files" | "content" }` to search filenames or text
- `GET /api/tasks/{taskId}/files/watch` to stream debounced `WorkspaceFileEventBatch` NDJSON frames

Every task workspace route resolves the active task workspace through `ora-backend`; the client cannot select a root directory. The filesystem service rejects absolute paths, parent traversal, and symlink escapes. File reads are capped at 10 MiB and reject binary or invalid UTF-8 content. Search uses fixed-string matching for content, a 15-second timeout, an 8 MiB output bound, and at most 10,000 results. Watch events are coalesced for 100 ms before a batch is emitted. See [Task Workspace Files](task-workspace-files.md).

### specs

- `POST /api/specs/catalog` returns effective sources, bounded Markdown/MDX documents, and truncation state for a tagged Project or Task target.
- `POST /api/specs/read` reads one document only after revalidating that it still belongs to an enabled source.
- `POST /api/specs/resolve-source` converts a directory selected by the platform picker into a safe target-relative source.
- `PUT /api/projects/{projectId}/spec-sources` atomically replaces the project's source overrides.
- `POST /api/specs/watch` streams workspace file-event batches for the tagged target.

Spec catalog and read responses never expose an absolute workspace root. Discovery and source configuration are composed by the shared backend, so Web and Desktop retain identical source inference, path containment, persistence, and error semantics. See [Spec Management](spec-management.md).

### gitIdentity

- `GET /api/git/identity`

Each route translates transport input into the matching `ora-contracts` request DTO, delegates to the shared backend, and serializes the returned contract response without adding adapter-local response shapes.

Task payloads do not expose backend-owned worktree identifiers, and the runtime exposes no standalone public worktree endpoints — `/api/worktrees` and `/api/worktrees/{worktreeId}` are not part of the API.

Project branch responses separate the logical branch name, exact resolvable ref, and display label. Ora-managed branches use their task titles as labels while preserving the Git ref used to create a new worktree.

`GET /api/git/identity` returns the host's Git identity for the sidebar profile: the global Git config first, falling back to the authenticated GitHub CLI account when Git has no name configured.

### Agent runtime

Backend construction immediately attempts one supervised `acp` child per supported CLI, rooted at the user's home directory. Executable resolution is platform-specific: on Unix each CLI is read from its fixed per-user directory (`<home>/.opencode/bin/opencode`, `<home>/.nga/bin/nga`, `<home>/.codeagentcli/bin/codeagentcli`, `<home>/.claude/bin/claude-agent-acp`, `<home>/.codex/bin/codex-acp`); on Windows it is resolved from `PATH` through `where.exe` on every retry generation.

Each independent supervisor performs `initialize` once per process generation and retries failures without blocking healthy CLIs or non-agent APIs. Warming a session calls `session/new` on the connection selected by `agentCli` and keeps it in memory, capturing the configuration options and the available-command catalog the handshake announces; attach persists it against its Task and returns that catalog. Updates emitted before the response reveals the private provider session id are temporarily buffered, then attached to the matching session route. Load calls `session/load` using that private id and the Task worktree `cwd`; the public Session payload never exposes it. The load response streams Ora's own recorded conversation rather than the agent's replay, which is drained and discarded. `POST /api/sessions/{sessionId}/agent` rebinds a live conversation to a different CLI without changing its identifier, and `POST /api/sessions/{sessionId}/history/resume` returns a session whose history writes failed to a writable state. `GET /api/agent-runtime/status` reports each CLI's live ACP handshake status as ready, starting, or unavailable. A newly attached session accepts valid provider titles during its first prompt and bounded three/ten-second `session/list` window; restored sessions do not reopen title acquisition. Successful title writes update `Session.title` and emit `SessionTitleUpdated`, after which the client refetches sessions.

Warm sessions are keyed partly by the caller's `clientId`, which matters here specifically: one server process serves every browser tab, and sharing a warm session between two tabs would let the first attach take the other's conversation.

Prompt requests carry an ordered ACP content-block list and may combine text, images, audio, and resources. The serialized prompt is limited to 16 MiB. Load and prompt responses use `application/x-ndjson`; each line is one complete frame. Updates, permission requests, and terminating responses share one ordered per-session FIFO bounded at 256 items; connection loss and queue overflow remain separate terminal controls. Frames are limited to 8 MiB, and overflow terminates the operation rather than dropping updates silently. See [ACP Agent Runtime](agent-runtime.md).

Unary requests and streams receive a server-generated canonical request id before entering business logic. Client-provided `X-Request-Id` values are ignored. Every Web response publishes the canonical id through `X-Request-Id`, CORS exposes that header, and a failure body or error frame carries the same id in its direct `{ code, params, requestId }` payload. A stream keeps one id from creation through normal completion, failure, disconnect, or cancellation.

### Skill imports

`POST /api/skill-imports?mode=folder|archive` accepts one `multipart/form-data` source. Folder parts carry a validated source-relative path as their filename; archive mode accepts exactly one `.zip`, `.skill`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tgz` part. The adapter streams the upload to OS temporary storage before it calls the shared prepare service, so previewing never touches the database or committed skill packages.

Preparation snapshots and safely scans the source, rejects unsafe paths, links and archive expansion attacks, then returns an opaque session id and every discovered candidate. `GET` renews the prepared session while it is within its idle and absolute lifetime. `POST .../commit` returns `202 Accepted` after it freezes every conflict decision; the background job remains observable via `GET`. `DELETE` cancels only prepared sessions.

Each created, updated, overwritten, or deleted skill is atomic across its SQLite row and `<ORA_DATA_DIR>/atoms/skills/<name>/` package. The package transaction uses a same-filesystem staging directory and backup, while import sources remain in OS temp because it may be a different filesystem. Startup recovers interrupted package transactions, removes unowned package directories, and refuses to start if a visible row lacks its package or root `SKILL.md`.

### Filesystem browsing

The filesystem directory route supports the custom Web path picker.

- Omitting `path` lists the Web Server process user's home directory.
- Supplied paths must be absolute. Relative paths return `invalid_file_system_path`.
- Responses include the current path, parent path, server-derived breadcrumbs, and all child entries.
- Hidden entries are included. Symbolic links remain visible and preserve their link paths; broken links are reported as unavailable entries.
- Directories sort before files, and the endpoint returns the complete directory without pagination.
- The route intentionally has no configured browse root and can navigate outside home. Deployments must account for the exposed server directory metadata when setting network access to the Web Server.

## Error semantics

Error mapping is centralized so application outcomes become stable HTTP responses instead of leaking internal formatting.

- A not-found outcome from any project, task, session, skill, or agent get, update, or delete route returns an HTTP not-found status with a structured error payload identifying the missing entity family.
- A repository or bootstrap failure returns an HTTP server-error status with a structured error payload rather than raw infrastructure error text.
- Task-create failures caused by linked-worktree provisioning or compensating cleanup return a structured server error identifying task creation as failed, without exposing Git command output or filesystem-specific formatting.
- An occupied project returns `409`.
- Skill upload body limits return `413`; file-set and manifest validation return `422`; an existing committed skill directory returns `409`. All use the same typed contract body and canonical request id as other failures.

Shared backend failures project to the same typed `{ code, params, requestId }` payload used by Desktop; there is no public message or outer error envelope. HTTP status derives from the backend error classification.

Task workspace failures use the same mapping: missing task or workspace path returns a typed not-found response, invalid relative paths and unreadable text return a typed bad request, and bounded-output failures retain their native `413`/`422` classification. Watch failures are emitted as `{ "type": "error", "error": { "code", "params", "requestId" } }` frames rather than raw filesystem messages.

## Frontend development

- `task run:backend` starts the Rust HTTP backend on its default port.
- `task run:frontend` starts Vite and expects the backend to run separately.

Long-lived task workspace watch responses defer completion until an end or error frame so the request id, error payload, and log event remain correlated. This keeps the watcher aligned with the ACP stream lifecycle and prevents an early success event followed by a duplicate failure event.

## Storage behavior

The runtime uses a file-backed SQLite database bootstrapped through `ora-db`.

- Data persists across process restarts as long as the same `ORA_DATA_DIR` is reused.
- Readiness depends on successful database bootstrap, repository-pool construction, and bootstrap-project reconciliation.
- The request seam emits at most one correlated completion event. Ordinary success is `INFO`, health and readiness success are `DEBUG`, and failure levels derive from the shared backend classification.
