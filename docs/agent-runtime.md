# ACP Agent Runtime

`ora-backend` starts one independently supervised ACP connection for each installed [agent plugin](../crates/backend/src/agent_runtime/plugin_agent/README.md) when a Backend instance opens — every agent Ora can reach is supplied by a plugin package, and there is no other source. Every persisted Ora Session owns a serialized actor, but actors targeting the same agent share its application-scoped ACP connection and route events by the private provider session id. One Session accepts only one prompt owner at a time, while load streams may follow that prompt and different Sessions remain concurrent. Session-scoped prompt cancellation reaches that owner without granting a load stream ownership or unloading the reusable Session.

## Process and Session Lifecycle

- Session contracts select an `agent_ref`: the agent provider's dotted package name (the `name` segment of an installed plugin's `<namespace>/<name>` id), carried as an open string. Which agents exist depends entirely on installed plugins and is not knowable when Ora is built, so an identity the runtime does not recognize means "that provider is not installed right now" — an ordinary runtime state reported as `agent_runtime_unavailable`, not corrupt data. Nothing is bundled: Ora ships with zero agents until the user installs plugin packages that supply them, one agent per package (see [plugin_agent](../crates/backend/src/agent_runtime/plugin_agent/README.md)).
- Supervisors are keyed by that identity. A plugin package declaring an identity another installed package already supervises is ignored rather than allowed to replace it. Only `agent`-kind packages supply an agent; `ui` packages contribute surfaces and are never supervised. The installed set comes from the plugin lifecycle, which is also the sole owner of plugin processes: a supervisor attaches to a running plugin (`PluginApi::attach_agent`, which starts an installed plugin on demand) instead of launching one, reads that generation's `agent/acp` notifications through a lossless tap, and asks the lifecycle to stop the plugin when a generation ends.
- The supervised set is reconciled whenever installed packages change. Installing a plugin makes its agent reachable in the running process, uninstalling it removes the supervisor, and every installed agent plugin can always start.
- The plugin owns the agent process end to end: it decides which CLI to run and relays ACP frames to the host over its `agent/acp` notification channel. The host never chooses a CLI or interprets what it says. It does own the OS process, and it resolves the executable path for a plugin that ships its own binary: `ora/childprocess/spawn` accepts either a `command` the operating system resolves or a `packageCommand` the host joins onto that plugin's install root, because a plugin is told no host path and cannot reliably compute one. A missing agent process reports `agent_not_installed` with the detail the plugin chose to surface; a package whose bundled executable will not resolve is a broken package rather than an absent CLI, and is not retried quietly.
- Task worktrees resolve through Task → Workspace id → stored Worktree branch name → Git's authoritative worktree metadata. A configured worktree creation root is never used to reconstruct an existing path. Main project workspaces resolve their stored location against the bootstrap path base (the parent of `ORA_DATA_DIR` in Desktop), not live process cwd.
- Backend startup reconciles stale Running rows to Stopped, then one dedicated runtime thread per agent attempts startup and performs `initialize`. Owning the runtimes here is necessary because synchronous Desktop bootstrap does not guarantee an ambient Tokio runtime. Each agent retries independently with capped exponential backoff; Ora remains available even if every initial attempt fails, and one unavailable agent does not disable the others. Operations targeting an unavailable agent report `agent_runtime_unavailable`. A missing agent process remains retryable and does not count as a crash. More than three genuine startup or connection failures in one minute publishes `Failing` and stops that agent's automatic retries for the rest of the process. A plugin whose registration does not implement the agent contract enters `Failing` immediately because every retry would repeat the same deterministic failure.
- Warm creates open a temporary setup-registration window and call `session/new` on the ready shared connection, but persist nothing. Because the provider session id is not known until the response arrives, otherwise-unrouted setup notifications are buffered during that window and transferred to the matching session route once its id is known. The latest setup-time `available_commands_update` is kept with the warm session, because nothing consumes its updates until it is attached and the announcement would otherwise be lost.
- Attach binds one warm session to its owning Task and persists the Ora Session under the identifier the client already holds, reporting the captured catalog as `AttachSessionResponse.availableCommands`. The guarded insert fails if its Task was deleted while the handshake was in flight. The session's history file is opened with its header record before the session can be prompted.
- Load registers a route on the current connection generation when the provider conversation is idle, marks the row Running, and calls `session/load` with the private `agentSessionId`. The caller's admission signal resolves only after the Running row is persisted (and the row's task and project were re-validated as visible), so an aggregate deletion that starts after admission is guaranteed to observe the Running session and refuse, while a deletion that already committed makes the admission itself fail. Every setup or replay failure restores Stopped. The agent's replay is drained and discarded — `session/load` is called so the agent restores the context it needs to answer the next prompt, not to tell Ora what the conversation was. What the client receives is Ora's own record, including typed notices for known holes rather than a transcript that silently appears continuous. If a prompt already owns the session, load replays the record through its attachment point and then follows later events from that prompt; it neither starts a second prompt nor takes ownership of the first. See [Session History](#session-history).
- Connection loss fails that agent's in-flight operations, marks only its registered Sessions Stopped, asks the plugin lifecycle to stop the old process, and only then starts a replacement. Sessions are loaded again only on demand; prompts are never replayed automatically.
- The `initialize` handshake advertises the client's session config-option capability. Agents withhold configuration options from clients that do not, so the model selector depends on it. Boolean options stay undeclared because Ora renders only id-valued selectors.

### First session title acquisition

A newly attached Session owns a runtime-only title window. It accepts valid `session_info_update` titles immediately, even before the first prompt completes. The first prompt only starts the fallback window when it ends with `EndTurn`, `MaxTokens`, or `MaxTurnRequests`; refusal, cancellation, request failure, and connection failure do not consume that eligibility.

- If initialization advertises `session/list`, the actor schedules attempts three and ten seconds after the eligible prompt. Each request is sent only while the actor is idle, uses the provider session id to select the matching entry, and has a five-second timeout.
- If `session/list` is not advertised, no list request is sent; the actor remains open to push titles until the ten-second boundary, then locks.
- Push and list titles share the same `SessionTitle` validation and persistence path. While the window is open, the last valid agent title whose database write succeeds wins. A duplicate title does not write or publish an event; blank, null, and overlong values are ignored. A user-driven rename locks the window so a later agent title cannot overwrite it.
- Scheduler callbacks enqueue actor commands only. A prompt, load, stop, switch, delete, user rename, queue failure, connection loss, or actor termination closes or preempts the window, so title polling never delays user work. A `TitleUpdate` received while a list request is in flight is handled and the request continues; a late `Cancel` belonging to a completed prompt is ignored. The acquisition state is not stored in SQLite and is disabled when an existing Session is restored. A user-driven rename locks the window (and re-persists the chosen title) so a later push or list title cannot overwrite it.
- After a successful title-only database update, the actor publishes `AppEvent::SessionTitleUpdated { session_id }`. The event is an invalidation hint, not a log; the frontend refetches the authoritative `Session.title`.

Actor-owned scheduler callbacks keep only a weak command sender. Once deletion, switching, or manager shutdown releases the last external sender, the actor command receiver closes and the actor releases its connection, recorder, repository, and scheduler clones. This is also why scheduler callbacks upgrade their sender at execution time rather than keeping a hidden actor-owning clone.

## Warm Sessions

ACP reports a session's configuration options — the model selector among them — only in the reply to `session/new` or `session/load`. A model therefore cannot be chosen until a session exists, so opening a chat surface creates one ahead of the first prompt.

- Warm sessions live only in memory. No Ora Session row exists until attach, so abandoning a chat leaves no empty history behind on the Ora side.
- Each warm session is keyed by `(target, agent_ref, owner)`, where target is a Task or a project root. Desktop interactive sessions use the single `Interactive` owner; workflow nodes use an internal `WorkflowNode { run_id, node_id }` owner so concurrent branches remain isolated without exposing UI identity in the contract.
- Two operations take a warm session out of the pool, and both reserve it first so a failure can hand it back rather than strand it. **Attach** names it by identifier, because that identifier becomes the Ora Session's own and the client has already keyed its optimistic turn to it. **Switching agent** names it by key instead, because the identifier is the pool's and is discarded — only the provider binding moves, onto a row that already exists. Naming by key is also what lets a switch resolve to a fresh entry instead of failing when the one warmed earlier is gone; naming by identifier cannot, which is why an attach whose entry was consumed reports `warm_session_not_found` and the client re-warms.
- One entry serves every session under a Task for a given CLI and owner, not one per conversation. So a model picked for an incoming CLI is shared by the surfaces under that owner, and a claim that finds the entry mid-attach transiently creates a second — the one-per-`(target, agent_ref, owner)` shape is a steady state, not an invariant held during a handover.
- The Ora session identifier is minted when the session is warmed, not when it is persisted, so the client never has to follow an identifier change. Before attach that identifier is absent from `getSession` and `listSessions`.
- The working directory is re-derived from the target on every request and compared with the one the session was created against. A worktree that moved or was recreated retires the session instead of quietly addressing a stale path.
- Configuration changes apply to warm and persisted sessions alike and are remembered. A superseded connection generation or the live-session bound releases the provider session while the entry survives as a cold record of the identifier, its directory, and the options the user chose.
- Nothing releases a warm session for having sat unused. A warm session is one the user never prompted, so an idle entry holds no conversation to reclaim; the live-session bound alone caps how many exist, and it is applied when another session is created. A chat left open and returned to is still live rather than rebuilt.
- Deleting a Task or project discards the warm sessions for its chat surfaces and returns their provider sessions. This is the only thing that reclaims them: the target is gone, so no request can name the entry again, and the live-session bound displaces it only once enough new surfaces are opened. A project delete cascades to its Tasks, so their surfaces are discarded alongside the project root's. A warm session being attached is left alone — that attach owns its provider session now.
- A cold entry is rebuilt transparently on the next use, replaying those options. A replay the agent rejects degrades to whatever the agent reports rather than failing a prompt the user already typed, and the corrected options reach the client as a `session/update`.
- Attach rebuilds rather than reuses when the Task's directory differs from the warm session's, which is what makes it safe to warm a direct chat against its project root before its Task exists.

## Session History

Ora records every conversation itself, in one append-only JSONL file per Session under the configured sessions root. This is what lets a conversation outlive one provider: it is replayed without asking the agent to recite it, and it can be handed to a different agent entirely. The file format, its ordering rules, and its failure semantics belong to [`ora-history`](../crates/history/README.md); this section covers only when the runtime uses them.

- The runtime records what it chose to keep, not what it sent. A prompt is recorded from the request blocks before the agent is called, and the provider's echoed `user_message_chunk` is ignored, so context Ora injected never enters the record.
- Streamed updates are recorded before they are forwarded. A client that disconnects mid-turn costs the stream, never the record of what the agent produced.
- Every prompt turn closes with its `stopReason`. Provider replay never carried this, so a cancelled turn used to be indistinguishable from a completed one; replaying Ora's record restores it, along with the tool calls that never finished.
- The turn boundary settles tool calls the agent left open. ACP does not require an agent to report a terminal status, and an agent that opens a call and moves on would otherwise record work that appears to still be running forever. Only a turn the agent ended on its own terms records those calls as completed. Every other ending — cancelled, out of tokens, refused — leaves them unfinished, because the call may have been interrupted rather than finished and `stopReason` already says which. Since the runtime records a lost connection, a failed prompt, an overflowing queue, and a disconnected client all as cancelled, a tool interrupted by any of them keeps its unfinished status rather than being credited with a result nobody saw. Readers settle what the record leaves unfinished: the conversation view shows a cut-short turn's open calls as interrupted, and the handoff transcript names their outcome as unreported rather than claiming the tool never ran.
- Ordered session events make the response a turn fence. Updates and permission requests observed before it are consumed by the same operation, and the turn is recorded only after that fence is settled. Cancellation keeps consuming through the matching response during its grace period; if the provider does not settle, the actor records the accepted event snapshot before isolating the route.
- Writes are batched per settled item, flushed but not synced. A crash costs at most the item in flight.
- A complete JSONL line that cannot be decoded is omitted from replay but reported as an `unreadable_records` history notice with the aggregate count. Its turn position is unknown because append order is not timeline order, so neither the backend nor client guesses one. The conversation remains writable: past corruption is an integrity warning, while `historyState` continues to describe whether new records can be appended. Existing durable `Gap` records are replayed as `unrecorded_content` notices instead of being skipped. The chat store stages notices with the rest of a load, the UI keeps a non-blocking warning above the conversation, and an agent handoff labels the surviving transcript incomplete.

### Switching Agents

`switchSessionAgent` moves one conversation onto a different CLI. The session keeps its identifier, its Task, and its history; only the binding changes.

- The new binding is **claimed from the warm pool** rather than handshaken here, addressed by the same `(target, agent_ref, Interactive)` key the Desktop surface warmed while its picker was showing that CLI's models. So the conversation lands on the very session the user configured — a model chosen before the move survives it — and the common case costs no round trip. A key whose entry was evicted, consumed, or is mid-attach resolves to a fresh entry that is handshaken during the claim, so a switch never fails merely because what was warmed earlier is gone.
- Resolving and reserving the entry happen in one critical section, so no other claim can take the session in between. Like attach, the claim runs before the lifecycle lock: a CLI slow to answer never stalls unrelated sessions.
- Nothing is torn down until the claim succeeds, so an unavailable CLI leaves the conversation exactly where it was. Switching to the CLI a session already runs on reports `session_agent_unchanged` — checked _before_ claiming, since warming that CLI would build a second provider session only to replace the binding with an indistinguishable one. A session whose history is degraded reports `session_history_degraded`.
- A failure _after_ the claim returns the entry to the warm pool by dropping its reservation, leaving the provider session alive and reusable for a retry. Ora never closes it here: the pool owns that decision, and it prefers `session/delete` for a session the user has never seen.
- Because the rebind stops the current binding's actor, the client is expected to commit the move **with the next message** rather than when the CLI is picked — picking is recorded client-side and warms the incoming CLI, which is what lets the model list be replaced without interrupting an agent that may be mid-reply. Only the binding decides what that record means: picks accumulate freely while nothing is committed, so a client that arrives back at the CLI its session is still bound to withdraws the record instead of committing a move onto it — that request is exactly what `session_agent_unchanged` refuses.
- Once the move is certain the old binding is released. It is not kept for a later switch back: its context stops at the moment it was left, so returning to it would need the intervening turns anyway — and injecting a full transcript into a fresh session is simpler and more predictable than reconciling a stale one.
- The transcript is injected **lazily**. Switching sends nothing; the recorded conversation is prepended to the next prompt as a leading content block. A session switched and then abandoned costs nothing.
- The response carries the claimed session's `availableCommands` and `configOptions`. ACP reports both only while a session is being created or loaded, so anything not returned here can never be asked for again — a client that heard only about the rebound session would keep offering the previous CLI's models. This is why a claim carries the options recorded on its entry rather than leaving the caller to re-derive them.
- Whether the current binding still needs the transcript is derived from the record — a trailing `AgentSwitched` with no `HandoffDelivered` after it — so it survives losing the actor that tracked it, and a restart, without any stored flag.
- The debt is settled only once the provider has **accepted** the prompt carrying the transcript, in memory and in the file together. Everything before that point can still fail: a history Ora cannot read at injection time, a prompt refused because its own write failed, and a `session/prompt` that never left the process all leave the binding still owing its transcript, and the next prompt carries it instead. A user turn cannot stand in for the delivery record, because Ora records a prompt _before_ sending it — one sitting after a switch is equally consistent with a delivered transcript and with a request that failed on the way out.
- Accepting the request is the last thing Ora can observe about delivery; past it the frame is on the agent's stdin. A connection lost mid-turn therefore counts as delivered rather than re-injecting the whole conversation into an agent that already holds it — the transcript's preamble, which tells its reader the work belongs to a _different_ agent, would be false if it did. Failing to record the delivery goes the other way and hands the transcript over again, which is the harmless direction to be wrong in.
- ACP offers no way to install a conversation into an agent: `session/new` takes no context and `session/prompt` takes one user turn. Every recorded turn therefore collapses into a single user message that the receiving agent is _shown_ rather than one it took part in, which is what the injected block's preamble exists to explain.
- There is no size budget on the transcript. A long conversation can exceed the receiving model's context window, and that failure surfaces from the provider.

### Degraded History

A history that skips records is more dangerous than one that stops, because the gap is invisible to whoever replays it — including the next agent. So a failed write stops recording that session for good rather than continuing past the hole.

- A turn already streaming finishes: the agent's work is real whether or not the file kept it, and failing it would tell the user nothing happened when something did.
- A turn whose own prompt could not be recorded is refused before the agent is called. Nothing has happened yet, so nothing is lost by refusing it, and sending it would move the conversation somewhere the record cannot follow. If that prompt was the one carrying a handoff transcript, the binding still owes it — no delivery was recorded — and the next prompt carries it instead.
- The session moves to `historyState: degraded` carrying the operating-system reason, and further prompts are refused with `session_history_degraded` until it is resumed.
- `resumeSessionHistory` appends a `Gap` record naming what interrupted the file _before_ accepting new content, then returns the session to writable. Resuming does not restore what was lost; it records that something was.
- A history file Ora cannot read at all degrades the session the same way. Appending without knowing which positions are already used would overwrite them. This is distinct from individual complete lines that are unreadable: those preserve the surviving timeline and surface an integrity notice as described above.
- A load whose history cannot be read fails the load rather than completing an empty one. Load is how a user asks to see the conversation, and an empty view is indistinguishable from a session that never said anything.

### Deletion

Ora's soft delete is what a user experiences as deletion, so the conversation goes with it: deleting a Session removes its history file, and Task and Project cascades remove the files of every session they take with them. The session identifiers are collected before the cascade, because afterwards nothing links the files back to the task that owned them. Removal is best effort — the rows are already gone, an orphaned file is unreachable, and failing here would leave the user with something they cannot delete.

## Flow Control

ACP stdout is newline-delimited JSON-RPC with an 8 MiB frame limit. The connection reader uses an unbounded, ordered handoff to the always-running central router, while each registered Session owns a bounded 256-item FIFO for updates, permission requests, and terminating responses. Connection loss and queue overflow use an independent control queue. This keeps connection-wide parsing from imposing one Session's backpressure on another while preserving the event order needed to close a turn safely. A per-Session overflow stops only the affected Session; an active operation drains events already accepted before applying that terminal control.

Session setup has a separate bounded buffer for notifications that arrive before `session/new` reveals their provider session id. It is active only while one or more creates are in flight, holds at most 256 notifications across those setups, and retains the newest notifications when full. Registering a session drains only notifications whose provider id matches that route; when the final setup window closes, any still-unmatched notifications are discarded as stale.

Unknown agent-originated JSON-RPC requests receive a correlated `-32601` method-not-found response and do not terminate the connection. Malformed frames, unmatched responses, oversized frames, and stdio loss are connection failures. Routes are generation-bound, so updates from an old connection or an unloaded Session are treated as stale and discarded rather than taking down unrelated work.

Permission requests are part of the ordered session FIFO, so a prompt consumes them in the same order in which the provider emitted them and can correlate the user's response to the active operation. A permission request arriving during `session/load` or while the session is idle is answered as cancelled; the operation reports the backend's typed internal error when protocol traffic violates that lifecycle boundary. Connection loss and queue overflow remain separate terminal controls.

Dropping a Web body, closing a Tauri stream, or aborting the frontend `AsyncIterable` sends `session/cancel`. A session-level timeout unloads and stops only that Session; it never restarts the shared process. Explicit Stop optionally calls `session/close` when advertised, unloads the route, and preserves provider history for a later load.

History replay is the one stream that applies backpressure instead of failing fast. A recorded conversation is far larger than the 256-item queue, and a consumer that has not drained it yet is not a disconnected one.

## Timeouts and Limits

| Bound                                | Value                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `initialize` handshake               | 15 s                                         |
| Load and prompt inactivity deadline  | 30 s, reset by each session update           |
| Cancellation settlement grace        | 5 s                                          |
| Connection retry backoff             | 250 ms, doubling to a 30 s cap               |
| Connection crash circuit             | Opens after more than 3 failures in 1 minute |
| Session-list title request           | 5 s per attempt                              |
| First-title fallback window          | 3 s and 10 s after the first eligible prompt |
| Session update and event queue depth | 256 items                                    |
| JSON-RPC frame size                  | 8 MiB                                        |
| Serialized structured prompt size    | 16 MiB                                       |
| Handoff transcript size              | unbounded                                    |

The load and prompt deadline is an inactivity timer rather than a total budget: a provider that keeps streaming updates can run indefinitely, while one that goes silent for 30 seconds fails that Session alone. Prompts are passed through as ordered ACP `ContentBlock` values, including text, images, audio, resource links, and embedded resources. An empty list or a list containing only blank text is rejected, and the 16 MiB limit is measured from the serialized JSON payload before it reaches the provider.

## Ownership Boundaries

Ora deletion removes Ora-owned database records and the session history Ora itself wrote, and registers durable Git cleanup jobs (executed asynchronously by the backend worker) for the deleted tasks' worktrees and `ora/*` branches. Provider-side history survives a deletion on the Ora side. ACP session delete is called in exactly one case: retiring a warm session that Ora created, never persisted, and never handed to the user. Those sessions carry no history and no Ora record, and deleting them is what stops abandoned chat surfaces from accumulating empty sessions inside providers that persist them. Every session the user can see is closed, never deleted. Session deletion serializes against new actor operations, unloads its route, soft-deletes the row under the same lifecycle guard, and then removes the history file. Task and Project deletion reject Running descendants and transactionally cascade stopped Ora records.

Ora owns the transcript; the agent owns the model context. That split is what the whole design turns on: the transcript is portable between agents and the context is not, which is why a switch replays nothing and injects instead.

Dropping the last Backend owner asks every supervisor to stop accepting work, cancels routed operations, and initiates bounded termination and reaping of each CLI process tree. Successful processes remain alive while the Backend exists even when no Sessions are registered.

## Caveats After Opening the Agent Identity

Agent identity is an open string: agents arrive with installed plugins, and which ones exist is not
knowable when Ora is built. Persistence never had to move — the `agent_cli` column already stored
`ora-space.claude`-style namespaced values — but one store held an _older_, pre-namespaced spelling
and is worth knowing about:

- **Workflow graphs may still name an agent by an old short id.** A saved graph persists
  `executor.agentCli` inside its snapshot JSON, and a snapshot saved before identities were
  namespaced can hold `open_code` rather than `ora-space.opencode`. That value is carried through
  to the runtime as written, so it matches no supervised agent and the node fails as an unavailable
  provider until the model is picked again. Nothing rewrites it: translating old spellings would be
  a compatibility layer, and rewriting snapshot JSON is a database migration that should be decided
  on deliberately rather than smuggled in. Re-picking the model on an affected node fixes it
  permanently.

The frontend agent catalog is entirely runtime-derived — the chat and workflow pickers list
whatever `listInstalled` reports as `kind: "agent"`, labelled and drawn with each package's own
`agentDisplayName` and `logo`, offering only the identities `getAgentRuntimeStatus` reports
`Ready` or `Starting` for. That one status answer already covers every way an agent can be out of
reach — a package that was never installed and so has no supervisor, and an agent process missing
on this machine — so the client models none of them separately.
`Unavailable` is polled on at a slow cadence because it is expected configuration that can resolve
itself; `Failing` is not, because the restart circuit is open for the rest of the process. A
stored preference naming an agent that is no longer reachable is carried forward unexamined rather
than dropped — the frontend does not validate agent identities against a closed set — and a
session's own binding is always reported as written, since that is what the conversation genuinely
runs on.
