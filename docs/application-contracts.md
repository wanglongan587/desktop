# Application and Contracts Boundary

The public application surface is split across `ora-domain`, `ora-contracts`, `ora-application`, `ora-db`, `ora-backend`, and transport adapters so use-case orchestration and ACP streams are shared without coupling them to HTTP or Tauri.

## Ownership

- `ora-domain` owns schema-backed entities, identifier newtypes, and categorical enums. See [Domain Models](domain-models.md).
- `ora-contracts` owns serialization-friendly request, response, stream-event, and public-error DTOs for Project, Task, Session, Skill, Agent, Spec, and Git identity operations, plus the Web-only project work context and filesystem operations.
- `ora-contracts` keeps Rust field names idiomatic while serializing JSON payloads in `camelCase` for adapter and frontend consumption.
- `ora-contracts` also owns the frontend endpoint manifest for the exported HTTP surface, including operation names, client namespaces, methods, path templates, path and query parameters, request and response types, JSON body behavior, and unary-versus-stream response mode.
- `ora-contracts` exports TypeScript DTOs into `packages/contracts/src` so frontend packages consume the contract surface from `@ora/contracts` and the browser transport from `@ora/contracts/fetch`. See [Frontend Contract SDK](frontend-contract-sdk.md).
- `ora-application` owns use-case handlers, `ApplicationError`, the repository/clock/identity/provisioning ports those handlers depend on, and domain-to-contract mapping. It also owns project work context lease timing and occupancy conflicts.
- `ora-db` implements those ports on SQLite and owns schema reconciliation. See [Database Repositories](database-repositories.md).
- `ora-backend` owns SQLite bootstrap, the system clock, concrete repository and handler composition, transactional aggregate deletion, dynamic project selection for task Git operations, one application-scoped supervisor per supported agent CLI, grouped model discovery, per-session ACP routing, transport-neutral public error projection, and the shared request lifecycle used by runtime adapters.
- Transport adapters stay thin: Web handlers and Tauri commands accept contract requests, delegate to the same `Backend`, then map its stable public errors into HTTP or IPC semantics.
- `ProjectWorkContext` and filesystem browsing are deliberately outside `ora-backend`. The Web server keeps those services composed directly from the repository pool; Desktop's transport reports `unsupported_operation` for those three contract operations.

## Contract shapes

Contracts are the app-facing protocol, not a projection of the domain. Each entity has one shared public view model reused across create, get, list, and update responses instead of separate summary and detail variants:

- `Project`: `id`, `name`, `rootPath`
- `Task`: `id`, `projectId`, `title`, `status`, `workspaceMode`
- `Session`: `id`, `taskId`, `agentCli`, `status`
- `Skill` and `Agent`: `id`, `name`, `description`
- `ProjectWorkContext`: `id`, `surface`, `windowId`, `projectId`, `leaseExpiresAt`
- `SpecDocument`: `id`, `sourceName`, `path`, `title`
- `SpecSource`: `name`, `glob`

Public payloads expose documented business fields only. `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `isDeleted`, and other internal audit fields never appear. Two exclusions are deliberate:

- Task worktrees are backend-owned, so no contract carries a `worktreeId`, and there are no standalone worktree DTOs or SDK operations. `CreateTaskRequest` takes `projectId`, `title`, `status`, and an optional `workspaceMode`; `UpdateTaskRequest` takes `taskId`, `title`, and `status`. See [Task Worktrees](task-worktrees.md).
- A session's private provider session id is never exposed. It is persisted and used internally for `session/load`, but the public `Session` payload omits it.

Because adapters and generated frontend types bind to `ora-contracts` rather than to domain models, the domain layer can add internal fields or invariants without those details leaking into the protocol.

## Public errors

Public failures serialize directly as `{ code, params, requestId }`. `RequestId` is UUID-backed, and `PublicError` is a discriminated union with one named parameter shape per code, including explicit empty parameters. The contract exposes neither an internal message nor an outer error envelope.

The backend maps the highest semantic application error exhaustively to both a public error and one transport-neutral classification: `InvalidRequest`, `NotFound`, `Conflict`, or `Internal`. Infrastructure failures become `internal_error` while their Rust `Error::source()` chains remain available for diagnostics outside the serialized contract. Adapters never infer public codes by inspecting source chains or matching error strings.

## Handlers

`ora-application` handlers are transport-agnostic entry points. Each accepts exactly one request contract type and returns exactly one response contract type or an `ApplicationError`, referencing no HTTP, Tauri, or database type. An HTTP route or Tauri command can therefore deserialize transport input into one contract value, call the handler, and serialize the result with no extra use-case orchestration in the adapter.

Handlers own their ports, so a unit test can construct any handler with in-memory fakes and execute the full use case with no database, HTTP server, Git process, or Tauri runtime. Dependencies are statically dispatched through generics rather than trait objects.

The handler set is intentionally narrower than full CRUD per entity, because some lifecycles are owned elsewhere:

| Module | Handlers |
| --- | --- |
| `project` | create, get, list, update |
| `task` | create, get, list, update |
| `session` | get, list, delete |
| `skill` | create, get, list, update, delete |
| `agent_definition` | create, get, list, update, delete |
| `project_work_context` | open, renew |
| `spec` | list, read |
| `worktree` | none — ports only |

Notable consequences:

- There is no delete handler for `project` or `task`. Aggregate deletion is a transactional cascade owned by `ora-backend` and `ora-db`, because it has to reject running descendants and update several tables atomically.
- Session creation, load, prompt, permission response, cancellation, and stop belong to the backend agent runtime, not to `ora-application`. The session module supplies only the persistence-facing reads and soft deletion.
- `worktree` has no handlers or transport contracts at all. Worktree records are internal metadata coordinated by the task module.
- `spec` reads repository files instead of the database. Its `SpecWorkspaceResolver` and `SpecCatalogReader` ports are implemented in `ora-backend` on top of the `ora-spec` crate, which owns glob discovery, frontmatter parsing, content hashing, and the filesystem watcher. Discovery defaults include a workspace-root `SPEC.md` plus OpenSpec / Superpowers / `docs/specs` layouts when `.ora/specs.toml` is absent; a present config file replaces those presets. Nothing about a spec is persisted, so the catalog is always rebuildable from disk, and `ListSpecsResponse` returns the configured sources so the frontend can recognize a spec an agent just wrote before the index has observed it. Omitting `taskId` targets the project root; supplying it targets that task's workspace (a worktree-backed task is a different tree).

`project_id`, `task_id`, and `worktree_id` are treated as pass-through business identifiers. Create and update handlers do not perform extra cross-entity existence checks before delegating to their repositories; `OpenProjectWorkContextHandler` verifying the requested project is the one deliberate exception, because occupancy has to be evaluated against a real project.

Deletion stays a normal delete use case at the boundary even though the repository implements it as a soft delete. Callers interact with delete-oriented request and response contracts and never see soft-delete or archive semantics.

## Error propagation and completion logging

Application handlers preserve semantic errors and infrastructure source chains without emitting generic success or propagation-only failure events. Repository adapters likewise do not add another event merely to report the same failure. Web, Tauri, and stream entry seams own the single correlated request-completion event and derive its level from the public classification.

Bootstrap, migration, state-transition, and secondary-cleanup events remain independent lifecycle facts. Logging initialization, sink selection, and writer lifetimes stay with runtime composition roots. See [Runtime Logging](runtime-logging.md).

## Slice invariants

- Project roots are immutable after creation; `UpdateProjectHandler` renames only.
- Session routing — task, provider CLI, and provider session id — is immutable. Lifecycle operations change only `status` and `updated_at`.
- `UpdateTaskRequest` cannot change project ownership, and task updates preserve the existing worktree association.
- Project and Task deletion soft-delete the complete Ora-owned aggregate in one SQLite transaction. A running Session rejects the operation with `resource_in_use`; stopped children are cascaded. These paths never call Git and never delete provider-owned ACP history.
- Task creation resolves the requested project's Git root at creation time. Deletion changes Ora database records only and deliberately leaves the linked Git worktree and its branch untouched.
- Worktree paths are composed only when creating a new worktree. Existing paths are resolved from the persisted branch name and Git's authoritative metadata, never reconstructed from the configured creation root.
