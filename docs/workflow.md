# Workflow

English | [中文](workflow.zh.md)

`ora-application` owns the workflow definition use cases, with persistence in `ora-db` and public contracts in `ora-contracts`. Workflows manage editable agent orchestration graphs with draft-as-workspace semantics and immutable published snapshots.

## Entities and tables

| Domain type        | Backing table        |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `Workflow`         | `workflows`          |
| `WorkflowSnapshot` | `workflow_snapshots` |

`Workflow` holds the stable identity (name, published snapshot pointer, audit fields) while `WorkflowSnapshot` owns the versioned React Flow graph. Read models (`WorkflowDetail`, `WorkflowSummary`, `WorkflowVersion`) keep graph data out of list responses. The library list is newest-created first so a just-created workflow is the first row.

## Draft, publish, and version lifecycle

Every workflow has exactly one `draft` snapshot created atomically with the workflow itself. The draft is an editable workspace: `UpdateDraft` mutates its graph in-place without creating a new snapshot row.

The settings library can duplicate a workflow by creating a new identity and draft from the source's current draft graph. A duplicate never carries published snapshots, the active published pointer, or workflow runs; it starts as an editable, unpublished workflow.

Publishing copies the draft's graph into a new, immutable snapshot. `updated_at` on published snapshots is `NULL`, including after soft deletion — only draft editing changes that field. Publish always activates the new snapshot (sets `workflows.published_snapshot_id`), making it the version used by any future workflow execution.

Additional operations keep the version model flexible without data loss:

- **Rollback** copies any historical snapshot's graph into the draft. It does not change the published pointer, so the active version stays unchanged while the editor workspace resets to a known state.
- **Activate** switches the published pointer to a different snapshot and syncs its graph into the draft. This is the explicit "make this version live" operation for cases where publish-and-activate-together is not desired.
- **Snapshot deletion** removes individual published snapshots but refuses to delete the draft or the currently active version.

## Identifiers and versioning

`WorkflowId` and `WorkflowSnapshotId` are UUID-backed newtypes following the same `define_id!` macro convention as every other domain entity.

Snapshot versions are strings. The draft is identified by the reserved string `"draft"`. Published versions can be user-provided (e.g. `"v1.0.0"`) or automatically derived as `v{timestamp_millis}` from the same injected application clock that supplies `created_at`. If an automatic version collides in the same millisecond, a numeric suffix is added without changing its clock-derived prefix. User-provided versions must be non-blank, at most 128 bytes, safe for a single URL path segment, and cannot be `"."` or `".."`. A partial unique index prevents duplicate visible versions within one workflow, so a soft-deleted version name may be reused.

## Graph storage

The `graph` column stores the complete React Flow JSON document. Workflow definition CRUD treats it as an opaque string. The [workflow run engine](../crates/application/src/workflow_run/engine/README.md) parses and validates the frozen snapshot when a run starts.

## Agent-node MCP bindings

The Agent inspector reads installed `kind: "mcp"` plugins, displaying their names, canonical IDs,
and configuration availability. Authors can add, enable, disable, and remove bindings independently
for each node. Adding enables the binding. Loading failures offer retry and preserve existing
bindings; missing plugins remain visible by ID and can still be disabled or removed.

Bindings use `mcps: [{ mcpId, enabled }]` in the graph, where `mcpId` is the full installed plugin
ID. Draft save, publish, duplicate, and import/export retain these values, including disabled
bindings. No selection (including old graphs without `mcps`) means no MCP servers for that node.
Legacy demo IDs are retained without guessing a replacement. Empty IDs, duplicate IDs, and invalid
field types are rejected when parsing the executable graph.

Execution uses the frozen run's enabled IDs throughout Session creation, restore, rebuild, and
refresh. Editing a draft affects later runs only. An unavailable enabled dependency fails the node
with an explicit error; it is never silently skipped. Unselected plugins cannot block the node.
Ordinary chats keep automatic discovery. Package and configuration updates for selected plugins
still use the existing safe refresh boundary; no credentials are persisted in the graph. See
[Session MCP](session-mcp.md) for runtime delivery and refresh behavior.

## Handlers

The `workflow` module exposes the full set of CRUD and lifecycle handlers, all following the existing port-adapter pattern with `WorkflowRepository`, `WorkflowIdGenerator`, and `Clock`:

| Handler                   | Purpose                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `CreateWorkflowHandler`   | Create workflow with initial draft              |
| `GetWorkflowHandler`      | Fetch workflow + draft + published snapshot     |
| `ListWorkflowsHandler`    | List visible workflows without graph data       |
| `UpdateWorkflowHandler`   | Rename workflow                                 |
| `DeleteWorkflowHandler`   | Soft-delete workflow with cascade               |
| `GetDraftHandler`         | Fetch draft snapshot with graph                 |
| `UpdateDraftHandler`      | Mutate draft graph in-place                     |
| `PublishWorkflowHandler`  | Freeze draft as immutable snapshot and activate |
| `RollbackWorkflowHandler` | Copy historical graph into draft                |
| `ActivateWorkflowHandler` | Switch published pointer and sync draft         |
| `ListVersionsHandler`     | List published version summaries                |
| `GetVersionHandler`       | Fetch a specific snapshot by version string     |
| `DeleteSnapshotHandler`   | Soft-delete a published snapshot (constrained)  |

Unlike project and task, workflow deletion follows the standard CRUD handler pattern rather than a separate cascade repository, because the deletion constraints are simpler (no running-session check).

## Workflow runs

A workflow run freezes one published snapshot and executes directly in a caller-selected Workspace. A project's row targets its Main Workspace; a Task row targets that Task's Isolated Workspace. The run CRUD layer is graph-agnostic. The execution engine owns start/restart/HITL on top of the same repository; `ora-backend` implements `NodeExecutor` as `WorkflowRunNodeExecutor` and composes it at `Backend::open`.

Before an agent node is prompted, the backend turns the frozen graph and current node-run rows into a structured workflow handoff. The message identifies the current step and its direct neighbors, labels the resolved role as behavioral constraints, lists every node in deterministic topological order with its current status, and keeps the original run request separate. Predecessor outputs are never appended implicitly: the current node receives one only when its custom Prompt explicitly references the corresponding variable, such as `{{#agent-1.output#}}`. Ora's active display locale is frozen when the run is created, so every generated handoff in that run uses consistent Chinese or English copy even if the interface language later changes. User-authored node content and resolved variable values remain verbatim. Enabled skill slash commands remain at the beginning of the first text block because agent CLIs parse them positionally. That block also lists the actual skill-package paths in the selected Workspace and requires the Agent to use those materialized copies. When structured output is enabled, its object-rooted JSON Schema can be configured through either the visual field editor or the raw JSON Schema editor; both edit a dialog-local draft and update the node only when saved. The JSON Schema contract is appended after the ordinary workflow context. It constrains only the final assistant response to one bare JSON object, so the Agent can still reason, call tools, and modify files normally during the step.

Skill delivery is capability-driven. Effect owns physical Skill materialization in the Workspace. During run creation, the backend asks an `AgentSkillDeliveryProvider` for each skill-using node's validated, Workspace-relative discovery roots and freezes a per-node receipt containing the original skill id, executable slash-command name, and actual package paths; it does not copy or rewrite packages. Deploy-time skill resolution is origin-aware: a local skill resolves through its formal catalog directory and a plugin-imported skill through the immutable plugin package recorded in its catalog row, so a workflow bound to a plugin skill starts as long as that package is still installed and loadable. The current provider returns the shared `.agents/skills` root for every Agent. A future plugin-backed provider may return different or multiple roots without changing workflow creation, executor, or prompt-rendering code. Node execution consumes only the frozen receipt and never re-resolves skill names from the mutable global catalog; capability or catalog changes therefore affect new runs only.

The session history is the sole source of a node's complete conversation. `workflow_node_runs.output` always stores an Agent node's final assistant text for display, audit, and explicit access through `agent-1.output`, including when structured parsing or schema validation fails and the node is marked failed. The run-scoped variable pool lives in `workflow_runs.payload`: its catalog declares typed Start inputs and stable outputs from data-producing nodes, while enabled structured output additionally declares `agent-1.structured_output`. Condition nodes expose no variables and persist neither `output` nor `selected_branch_id`; their selected branch is private scheduler state in `conditionDecisions`, kept outside the variable pool while remaining restart-safe. A validated structured object is committed only on successful completion; invalid JSON never enters the variable pool. `variablePool.values` contains only assigned values. The run's kickoff instruction remains separate in `workflow_runs.input` and is never exposed as a selectable workflow variable. Start variables may deliberately remain unassigned in the workflow definition and be filled in on the deployed run's pre-start input screen. Each declaration may carry a human-facing display name and string/secret variables may impose a positive maximum character length; the same limit is enforced for editor defaults and deployment-time writes. User-defined workflow globals differ from runtime-owned system globals: each custom declaration requires both an explicit dotted name and a type-correct initial value before it can be saved. For each node, the editor exposes workflow globals plus variables from every direct predecessor. Condition nodes are scope-transparent: their downstream nodes see the original variables from the Condition's direct predecessors, including through a chain of Conditions, without creating a `condition.output`. Other transitive ancestors remain unavailable unless forwarded by a direct predecessor. Structured-output field paths are expanded in the same catalog, so Condition and Output selectors never rely on free-form text. Each terminal Output builds its own result object, so result names must be unique only within that node and may be reused by Outputs on separate branches. The pool is initialized from the frozen graph when a run is created and completed-node writes are committed in the same SQLite transaction as the node status transition. A node Session remains addressable by id for Theater, but standalone Session listing excludes every Session bound to a visible workflow node run so workflow execution never appears as an ordinary chat.

Workflow value types are enforced at graph parsing, editor entry, and variable-pool writes. `array` and `array[any]` both accept heterogeneous JSON arrays; the first is the concise unconstrained declaration and the second explicitly documents an unconstrained element type. Typed arrays validate every element. `file` is a durable Workspace-relative reference shaped as `{ "kind": "workspace_file", "path": "relative/path" }`, and `array[file]` is an array of those references. Editor path strings and legacy saved path strings are normalized into that object, while absolute paths, parent traversal, empty paths, and platform-reserved paths are rejected. Global-value placeholders are generated from this vocabulary, so changing a declaration's type immediately shows a parseable example. Structured Agent schemas use the same types, are validated recursively before execution, and generate a schema-derived valid JSON example in the Agent prompt. Agent-produced file fields must use the canonical object representation shown in that example.

Start inputs keep their form control separate from their variable-pool type. The editor supports text, paragraph, select, number, checkbox, single-file, file-list, and JSON controls, which emit `string`, `string`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `file`, `array[file]`, and `object` values respectively. Select choices, required state, and text length limits are frozen into the deployed snapshot and validated again at the execution boundary. Snapshots created before form controls were introduced continue to derive a compatible control from their declared value type.

### Entities and tables

| Domain type       | Backing table        |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| `WorkflowRun`     | `workflow_runs`      |
| `WorkflowNodeRun` | `workflow_node_runs` |

`WorkflowRun` pins `snapshot_id` to the user-released version it was created against and stores its own display name and `workspace_id`. `WorkflowNodeRun` records one executed node; nodes that never started have no row, and the frontend derives "not started" by comparing graph nodes against recorded node runs. Run and node status share the same five-value enums (`Pending | Running | Succeeded | Failed | Cancelled`). An interactive node parked awaiting follow-up input is persisted as `Pending`; the public contract derives a `Running` run with an awaiting node as `AwaitingInput` so the sidebar can surface that human action is needed. A session bound to a terminal node is read-only: the backend rejects new prompts against it.

### Creation and snapshot pinning

`CreateWorkflowRunHandler` admits the requested active `workspace_id`, resolves the frozen snapshot — an explicit `snapshot_id` or the workflow's `published_snapshot_id` — validates it belongs to the requested workflow together with the declared roles and Skill bindings, and persists the run. Runs start `Pending` with an empty `current_nodes` anchor. Creation compiles the run-scoped variable pool from the frozen graph and seeds the reserved `{start_id}.input` selector with the resolved kickoff text, so a node prompt can render the run instruction as a template variable as well as receiving it in the assembled workflow context. When the caller supplies no kickoff input, the run inherits the frozen snapshot's Start node instruction as its default input. Deployment gathers the run name, an editable run instruction, and typed values for any declared Start input variables before the run starts. The frontend obtains the exact Workspace from the project or Task row that opened the workflow picker; the backend does not infer a branch or create another worktree.

### Reading and deleting

Get returns the run with its display name and node runs; list returns project-scoped summaries. Node-run history is read-only in this layer — the engine owns node-run writes and the state machine.

Deletion refuses active runs — a `Running` run, a HITL pause with a non-terminal node run, or a `Running` session bound to one of the run's nodes — and then soft-deletes the run, its node runs, and node-owned sessions. A not-started `Pending` run (empty `current_nodes`, no node rows) can be discarded without cancelling. The selected Workspace is shared infrastructure and is never deleted with one run. Soft-deleted runs are invisible to queries and cannot be reactivated.

### Snapshot protection

A published snapshot referenced by a live run cannot be soft-deleted (`SnapshotInUse`), and deleting a workflow whose snapshots a live run freezes is refused (`ActiveRuns`), so a run's frozen graph stays readable across its lifecycle.

## Boundaries (non-goals)

- Workflow-run CRUD persists runs and node-run records but does not execute them. Graph execution, node-run writes, and the state machine (start/restart/HITL) are engine-owned in `ora-application`, with agent-node sessions driven by `ora-backend`'s `WorkflowRunNodeExecutor`. The initial runtime variable pool is deliberately stored in the existing `workflow_runs.payload` JSON column; no database migration or separate variable table is required.
- Graph validation at run start belongs to the workflow run engine, not the definition CRUD handlers.
- Tauri command registration and web-server route wiring are transport concerns owned by the respective adapters.
