# ora-utils::http

Generic, domain-free download capability used by crates that fetch release artifacts such as
`.orax` packages.

## Responsibilities

- `HttpDownload`: the uniform, injectable trait that a download operation must implement; callers
  run the returned future on their own runtime.
- Data types: `DownloadRequest`, `DownloadSource` (`Url` / `Local`), `Checksum` (+ `HashAlgorithm`),
  `DownloadOutcome`, `DownloadOptions` (byte limits, timeouts, retries) and `Progress`/`CancelToken`
  for streaming feedback.
- `LocalFileDownloader`: an offline implementation that copies a local file or `file://` URL to a
  destination while enforcing an optional byte limit, verifying an optional SHA-256 checksum, and
  atomically replacing the destination through a same-directory `.tmp` file.
- `ReqwestDownloader` (`http-reqwest` feature): streams remote HTTP(S) responses to a verified
  destination with per-phase timeouts, retry/backoff+jitter, progress callbacks, cancellation, byte
  limits, and checksum verification.
- Proxy resolution (`ProxyConfig` + `resolve_proxy`): an explicit proxy, then per-scheme
  environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY`), honoring `NO_PROXY` and a bypass
  list; otherwise a direct connection. Platform system-proxy reading is not yet implemented.

## Non-responsibilities

- Choosing a concrete transport: only `http` is shipped by default; the network backend is opt-in.
- TLS handling, redirect-target validation, resume, and digital-signature verification. The reqwest backend does, however, trust the operating system native certificate store (in addition to the bundled webpki roots) so it works behind corporate MITM proxies whose root CA is installed in the OS trust store, matching the behavior of a browser or `git` on the same machine.
- Concurrency budgeting across parallel installs; that is the orchestrator`s job.

## Key invariants

- The destination is only replaced after every check succeeds, so a failed download never corrupts
  an existing artifact and never leaves a `.tmp` file behind.
- A checksum mismatch or an exceeded byte limit aborts the whole copy with a structured
  `DownloadError` instead of a partial write.
- The digest is carried as raw bytes so hex parsing stays in the domain layer that reads a manifest.
