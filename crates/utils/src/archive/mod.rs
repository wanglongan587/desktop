//! Safe materialization of untrusted archives and folder trees into a destination directory.
//!
//! Every entry path passes [`StrictRelativePath`](crate::path::StrictRelativePath) validation
//! before anything is written, so zip-slip, traversal, and platform-unsafe names never reach the
//! filesystem. Encrypted archives, symlinks, and special entries are rejected, and cumulative
//! entry-count and byte budgets abort the whole tree instead of a single entry.
