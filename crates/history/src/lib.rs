//! Ora-owned session history: the durable record of what a conversation was.
//!
//! Ora is an ACP client, so the model context behind a session lives inside the
//! agent CLI that serves it. Owning the transcript separately is what lets a
//! conversation outlive one provider — it can be replayed without asking the
//! agent to recite it, and it can be handed to a different agent entirely.
//!
//! Nothing here performs ACP work or touches the database. The crate assembles
//! streamed updates into settled records, appends them, reads them back, and
//! renders them for another agent; deciding when to do any of that belongs to the
//! runtime that owns the session.
