# ora-backend

`ora-backend` is the transport-neutral composition root shared by Web and Tauri adapters. It opens persistent state, wires concrete application repositories and handlers, supervises agent providers, and exposes one stable `Backend` API over contract DTOs.

## Responsibilities

- `Backend::open` creates required directories, bootstraps and migrates SQLite, constructs CRUD APIs, and starts the [agent runtime](src/agent_runtime/README.md).
- Project, task, skill, and agent operations delegate to `ora-application`; aggregate deletion uses transactional database cascades.
- Session creation, loading, structured ACP prompting, permissions, stopping, deletion, and model discovery delegate to the agent runtime. Creation also returns the provider's setup-time available-command catalog.
- `BackendError` retains the internal source chain while exhaustively projecting semantic failures into a typed `PublicError` and one transport-neutral `ErrorClassification`. HTTP derives status from the classification; all adapters serialize the same direct `ContractError`.
- `RequestLifecycle` gives Web, Tauri, and stream seams one generated request id and an exactly-once success, failure, or cancellation completion event. Failure log levels derive from `ErrorClassification`.
- The configured worktree root affects only task creations that begin after an update. Existing task paths are resolved from persisted worktree identity and Git's authoritative metadata.
- Spec listing and reading resolve the requested workspace — a project root, or a task's own worktree — and serve it from one shared `ora-spec` catalog. Because that catalog watches the filesystem and keeps only the active workspace indexed, this crate owns its lifetime rather than creating one per request.

## Ownership boundaries

Project and task deletion soft-delete Ora-owned database records in one transaction and reject aggregates with running sessions. These paths do not call Git and do not delete provider-owned ACP history.

`ProjectWorkContext` and filesystem browsing remain outside this crate. Logging initialization and environment parsing belong to runtime composition roots. This crate provides the transport-neutral request lifecycle, while adapters decide where a request begins and completes.

Dropping the last backend owner shuts down provider supervisors and initiates bounded process-tree cleanup.
