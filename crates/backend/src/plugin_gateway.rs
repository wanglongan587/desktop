//! The narrow plugin data-plane API the desktop surface layer consumes.
//!
//! Surfaces live in the desktop shell, but the plugin processes they talk to are owned by the
//! backend's lifecycle. This gateway exposes only the operations a surface needs: look up the
//! installed package, resolve the plugin's writable directory, obtain a connection to its process
//! (starting it on demand), stop it when idle, subscribe to the notifications plugin processes
//! emit (`ui/push`), and register the surface closer. The wider plugin management API stays on
//! `Backend`.
