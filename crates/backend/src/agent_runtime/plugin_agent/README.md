# plugin_agent

`plugin_agent` turns one installed agent plugin into something the connection supervisor can treat
exactly like a built-in CLI. It attaches to a plugin process the plugin lifecycle already owns,
verifies the plugin declared the whole agent contract, brings the agent up, and exposes the
plugin's notification channel as an ACP message stream and sink.

This module is the only place in the agent runtime that knows a plugin exists. Everything above it
sees a `RuntimeConnection` and cannot tell which kind of provider produced it.

## Responsibilities

- Attach to one lifecycle-owned plugin process and read the notifications of that one generation.
- Reject, at handshake time, any plugin whose registration does not cover `agent/start`,
  `agent/stop`, `agent/listModels`, and the emitted `agent/acp`.
- Call `agent/start` and confirm the plugin will speak a protocol version this host understands.
- Read the plugin's pre-session model list through `agent/listModels`.
- Relay ACP messages in both directions as `agent/acp` notifications.
- Ask the plugin to stop its agent before the lifecycle ends the plugin's process tree.
- Convert registered Workspace-relative Skill locators into host-owned Effect surfaces. The
  canonical Plugin ID is the consumer identity; a plugin never chooses that persisted identity.
- Define `effect/waitForIdle` and `effect/restart` as the coordination boundary for surfaces using
  `wait_for_idle_and_restart`.

## Non-responsibilities

- Owning the plugin process. `ora-plugin-lifecycle` starts, stops, and reports every plugin
  process; this module borrows one and never spawns, kills, or reaps it.
- Discovering, validating, installing, or enabling plugin packages.
- Interpreting ACP. The host is a pipe for `agent/acp` payloads and never parses, validates, or
  rewrites them, which is what lets a plugin support ACP methods this host has never heard of.
- Supervising the agent's process. A plugin spawns and owns its agent CLI itself.
- Retry, backoff, crash-loop detection, and connection state. Those belong to the connection
  supervisor, which treats a dead plugin exactly as it treats a dead CLI.

## Process ownership

An attachment (`PluginApi::attach_agent`) is a `PluginGenerationLease` pinned to one process generation
plus a lossless tap of that generation's notifications, opened through the backend's notification
sink rather than by taking the process stream: the lifecycle's pump stays the only reader of the
process, and a restarted plugin can never leak frames into a connection that belonged to its
predecessor. A connection generation therefore owns its tap but not the process: ending a
generation asks the lifecycle to stop the plugin, which keeps the runtime state the settings
surface reports identical to what the agent runtime is actually talking to, and leaves the next
attach to start a fresh process rather than resuming a half-used one.

## Boundaries and failure semantics

The contract check runs the moment the attachment completes — before any session exists and before
a user is waiting on a prompt — so a plugin that does not implement the contract surfaces as a
failing agent rather than as a failure in the middle of someone's turn. That failure is terminal:
the supervisor publishes `Failing` and abandons the agent for the rest of the process instead of
retrying, because the same plugin will fail identically every time and retrying only produces a
warning per backoff interval.

`agent/start` failures split in two. `-32001` means the agent CLI is absent from this machine; that
is an expected local configuration, so it maps onto the same public error a missing built-in CLI
produces and is retried without logging or contributing to the crash counter. Every other code is a
genuine startup failure. More than three genuine failures in one minute opens the connection
supervisor's restart circuit, publishes `Failing` to the UI, and stops automatic retries.

A plugin the lifecycle refuses to start — because the user disabled it or uninstalled it — is
reported exactly like a missing CLI, so the supervisor keeps retrying it silently until the user
enables it again.

ACP travels as notifications rather than plugin method calls. ACP frames already carry their own
ids, cancellation, and ordering, so a second correlation layer would mean two timeouts and two
cancellation paths per frame, and the runtime's control-call timeout would sever prompts that
legitimately run for minutes.

A single unusable inbound frame — one that is not an object, or a notification method this runtime
does not consume — is dropped with a warning rather than failing the connection: one bad payload
must not end every live session on that agent. Frames that arrive before `agent/start` returns are
discarded, because they belong to no connection.

Teardown is `agent/stop`, then a lifecycle stop that sends `ora/shutdown` and kills the process
tree once the shutdown timeout expires, and waits until that tree has actually exited before a
replacement generation may start. `agent/stop` has its own short deadline, well inside the host's
cancellation grace, and the plugin is ended whether or not it answered — teardown must never be the
reason shutdown stalls. Plugin cleanup is best effort; final reclamation of the process tree is
always the host's.

The same boundary applies before a connection generation is published: contract verification,
`agent/start`, model discovery, or ACP initialization failure stops the plugin before the
connection supervisor schedules another attempt.

## Effect coordination

An Agent registration may include `effectSurfaces`. Each declaration contains
`workspaceRelativePath`, `materializationFormat`, and `coordination`; it never contains an absolute
Workspace path. Ora validates the portable relative locator, combines declarations from all live
Agent plugins, and persists one merged surface/consumer snapshot for every local Workspace.

For `wait_for_idle_and_restart`, the plugin must register both `effect/waitForIdle` and
`effect/restart`. `effect/waitForIdle` is idempotent by `surfaceKey`: it returns
`waiting_for_idle` while any affected instance is serving a turn, and returns `ready` only after it
has also blocked new turns that could read the surface. The barrier remains held until
`effect/restart` is called with the stable locator and applied generation. Restart must replace or
reinitialize every affected Agent instance before releasing the barrier. Ora can retry either call
after a process or database failure, so both methods must be idempotent.

`ora_backend::effect_worker` drives both calls. It claims a durable reconcile request and holds
that claim's lease while coordination waits on a consumer, so a plugin that never answers costs one
lease interval rather than the surface. A consumer whose plugin is not currently running is skipped
rather than started: it holds no turn a mutation could corrupt, and it reads the surface fresh when
it next starts.

## Sandboxing

Agent plugins currently receive `--allow-run` plus read, env, and network access, because they spawn
and own the agent CLI. The set itself is `ora_plugin_lifecycle::agent_permissions`, applied by the
lifecycle's launcher, which is the only place a plugin process is created. An agent plugin is
therefore roughly as privileged as the host itself. This is a deliberate, documented gap rather
than an oversight: capability narrowing is deferred until the agent contract is proven, and
closing it later changes only how the plugin is started, never the `agent/acp` pipe.
