//! Covers the notice that repairs live sessions after an agent process is replaced.
//!
//! Effect coordination restarts an Agent plugin so it re-reads a materialized surface, which takes
//! every provider-side session that process was holding down with it. Ora keeps those session ids,
//! so without this notice the next prompt is sent against an id the fresh process cannot resolve
//! and the conversation fails for good.
