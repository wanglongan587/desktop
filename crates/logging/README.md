# ora-logging

`ora-logging` owns Ora's process-wide structured logging contract, local clock, sink composition, and shared emission helpers.

## Responsibilities

- `init_logging` installs the subscriber from an explicit `LoggingConfig`, initializes the immutable process timezone, and returns `InitializedLogging`. Its `LoggingGuard` keeps non-blocking writers alive while its cloneable `LogLevelControl` reads or replaces the process-wide filter.
- Stdout and file sinks use a non-blocking, non-lossy writer: routine IO runs on a background worker, and a full channel exerts backpressure on callers instead of dropping lines, so log integrity wins under extreme sink stalls.
- Output modes support stdout, daily rotating files, or both, with retention cleanup for matching file series.
- Events are formatted as one JSON object per line with stable top-level timestamp, level, target, message, method, span, trace, and request fields; business and error fields are grouped consistently.
- `ora_trace!`, `ora_debug!`, `ora_info!`, `ora_warn!`, and `ora_error!` attach the current method name and preserve the shared event shape.
- Correlation helpers create spans whose trace and request identifiers propagate into nested events.
- `ErrorReport::from_error` renders an `Error::source()` chain for the single
  request-completion event emitted by runtime seams. Debug builds preserve original
  node text without redaction or rendered length limits; release builds emit a
  bounded, single-line, redacted chain. In both modes traversal itself stops after
  1,024 source nodes so a malformed cyclic chain cannot block completion logging,
  and `error.chain_depth` saturates at that safety limit when the chain continues.
- `clock` exposes local time and offsets from the IANA timezone fixed during startup.

## Boundaries

Initialization is process-wide and the timezone can be set only once. Runtime composition roots must parse environment configuration, call initialization before clock access, retain `LoggingGuard` for the process lifetime, and inject only cloned `LogLevelControl` values into runtime state that needs hot reload. Reloading changes eligibility for future events without rebuilding sinks or recovering events that were already filtered.

This crate does not decide business log messages, public error classification, field allowlists, or
read environment variables. Callers remain responsible for excluding sensitive structured fields
before the report's residual regex redaction. File rotation naming follows the underlying
appender's daily boundary, while event timestamps remain authoritative local timestamps.

Test helpers install a thread-scoped TRACE dispatcher so shared tracing callsite interest cannot make structured-log tests order-dependent.

See [Runtime Logging](../../docs/runtime-logging.md) for configuration and the JSON event contract.
