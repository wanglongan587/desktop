# Worktree Application Module

This module defines the application-facing persistence and identity boundary for backend-owned task worktrees.

`WorktreeRepository` provides visible-record CRUD and soft deletion for domain `Worktree` values. `WorktreeIdGenerator` supplies injectable identifiers, with `UuidWorktreeIdGenerator` as the production implementation.

The module intentionally has no standalone handlers or transport contracts. Worktree records are internal metadata coordinated by the task application module and backend session path; they are not an independent public CRUD resource.

Repository implementations must preserve stored branch identity and soft-delete semantics. They must not reconstruct checkout paths, invoke Git, or decide when a worktree should be created or removed. Git lifecycle belongs to `TaskWorktreeProvisioner`, while concrete persistence belongs to `ora-db`.

See the [ora-application overview](../../README.md) and [Task Application Module](../task/README.md).
