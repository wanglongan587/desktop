# Workflow Run Application Module

This module implements transport-independent CRUD use cases for workflow runs: each run freezes one published snapshot, owns a dedicated run-task and Git worktree, and can be created, listed, read, and soft-deleted.

## Responsibilities and boundaries

- Creation resolves the frozen snapshot (an explicit `snapshot_id` or the workflow's `published_snapshot_id`), validates it is published and belongs to the requested workflow, provisions a dedicated Git worktree, and atomically persists the worktree, run-task, and run in one repository-managed transaction. Runs start `Pending` with an empty `current_nodes` anchor; the default run-task title is `"{workflow.name} {创建时间}"`.
- Get and list operations expose visible records only. Detail queries join the run's display name (its task title) and node-run history; list queries return lightweight summaries scoped to one project.
- Node-run history is read-only here — node-run creation, updates, and their state machine belong to the execution engine, which writes through the same repository.
- Soft deletion refuses active runs (a `Running` run, a non-terminal node run, or a `Running` session on the run's task) and then cascades a soft-delete across the run, its node runs, its task's sessions, worktrees, and task row in one transaction. The handler removes the physical worktree through the task worktree provisioner.
- Snapshot protection lives in the `workflow` module: a published snapshot referenced by a live run cannot be soft-deleted, and a workflow whose snapshots a live run freezes cannot be deleted either, so a run's frozen graph stays readable across its lifecycle.

`WorkflowRunRepository`, `WorkflowRunIdGenerator`, `TaskIdGenerator`, `WorktreeIdGenerator`, `TaskWorkflowProvisioner`, and `Clock` isolate storage, identity, provisioning, and time from the handlers. The module maps domain entities to contract DTOs but does not parse the frozen snapshot graph, execute workflows, or choose transport semantics — those belong to the execution engine and transport adapters.
