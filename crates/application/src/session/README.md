# Session Application Module

This module provides the persistence-facing portion of Ora session lifecycle.

## Responsibilities

- `GetSessionHandler` and `ListSessionsHandler` map visible domain sessions to shared contract responses.
- `DeleteSessionHandler` soft-deletes a persisted session record using the injected clock and returns a stable not-found error when necessary.
- `SessionRepository` defines create, read, list, soft-delete, and single-intent session mutations used by application and backend composition. Title, status, binding, and history-state updates each own only their columns and return the latest complete session snapshot.
- `SessionIdGenerator` provides injectable session identity generation for runtime-owned creation flows.

Session creation, provider handshake, load, prompt, permission response, cancellation, stop, agent switching, and lifecycle serialization do not belong here. The backend agent runtime performs those operations and uses the repository port to persist state transitions.

Callers must stop and unload a running session before using the deletion handler. Neither Ora's recorded session history nor the provider's own history is touched by this module: the history file belongs to the backend agent runtime, which removes it alongside the row, and provider-owned history is outside Ora's persistence boundary entirely.

Session mutations are intentionally split into `update_session_title`, `update_session_status`, `update_session_binding`, and `update_session_history_state`. This prevents an actor or connection supervisor holding an older snapshot from overwriting a newer title or lifecycle state. None of these operations moves a session to another task.
