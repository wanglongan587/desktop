# ora-plugin-lifecycle

`ora-plugin-lifecycle` owns backend-only orchestration for installed Ora plugins. It joins
filesystem discovery, runtime state, application
invalidations, and the process data plane (calls and notifications) behind one lifecycle
interface.

## Control plane

This crate is the sole owner of plugin processes. Nothing else in Ora starts, stops, or reaps one,
which is what keeps the runtime state reported to the settings surface identical to the processes
that actually exist. Every installed plugin is available. Agent and workbench processes start on
demand and may be stopped without changing availability. Webview, skill, and MCP plugins have no
process and therefore remain in the `stopped` runtime state.

Consumers that need to speak a protocol over a plugin connect to it instead of launching it
(`ensure_running` / `connection`, see the data plane below). This is how the agent runtime reaches
an agent plugin: it holds a `PluginConnection` pinned to one generation and reads that generation's
notifications through the sink, while activate, stop, scan, and uninstall decide how long the
process lives.

Only explicit scans rebuild the installed snapshot. List responses additionally read the current
Plugin Configuration summary from immutable package declarations and plugin-global value files
under `<data-dir>/plugins/data/<namespace>/<name>/store.json`, so the settings list reflects
persisted completeness without a separate editor fetch. When the cached package root is no longer
a traversable directory, the summary stays `NotDeclared` rather than `configuration_load_failed`. Per-plugin actions operate on cached
identity, serialize changes for the same plugin, and allow unrelated plugins to progress
independently.
Plugins begin stopped whenever the lifecycle opens. A scan retains runtime state for a package
that remains installed and valid, while a newly discovered package becomes immediately available
and stopped. A package with an invalid Plugin Configuration declaration remains visible but cannot
start. Uninstall
closes surfaces, stops the process, then atomically stages the complete
`plugins/installed/<namespace>/<name>` tree and, when selected, `plugins/data/<namespace>/<name>`
before committing the removal. A staging failure attempts every staged move in reverse order and
reports any rollback failure; after commit, staging cleanup is independent and
empty namespace directories are pruned. Cleanup failures retain their staged paths in memory and
are retried by later scans without reversing the already committed uninstall.
Each scan retains runtime state for valid packages, stops runtimes whose packages were
removed or became invalid, and forgets removed packages. To return one coherent
snapshot, a scan acquires cached plugin operation locks in stable identifier order and may therefore
wait for an in-flight launch or stop to finish. This intentionally favors reconciliation consistency
over a partially refreshed result.

Every state transition is mirrored into a per-plugin `tokio::sync::watch` channel, which is what
`ensure_running` waits on; the managed-state map is only ever written through the accessors that
keep the two in sync.

## Launch

Plugins are identified by `ora_domain::PluginId` (`<namespace>/<name>`); request contracts carry
the canonical string, and a malformed id is reported as `PluginNotFound`. Installed packages live
in `<data-dir>/plugins/installed/<namespace>/<name>/<version>` (read-only, discovered by
`ora-plugin-manager`); uninstall stages that package tree and, when requested, the plugin's data
directory.

Before launching, the lifecycle creates `<data-dir>/plugins/data/<namespace>/<name>/` (with
`downloads/`) through `PluginDataDirectories`, derives Deno permissions from the plugin kind
(`permissions_for`: workbench plugins get no `--allow-*` flag at all; webview, skill, and MCP
plugins are never launched; agent plugins keep the broad historical set, also exported as
`agent_permissions` for the backend's agent supervisor, and narrowing it is out of scope here),
and passes the package root as working directory. No
environment variable is injected: a plugin learns nothing about host paths. A permission path
containing a comma refuses to launch, because Deno reads commas as list separators.

The Deno launcher binds a `PluginStorage` handler to the plugin's data directory and hands it to
the runtime as the `HostRequestHandler` for that process, so plugin identity is fixed by the
launch, never by request params.

After a successful handshake the registration is validated against the manifest kind
(`validate_registration`). Workbench registrations may expose well-formed methods but cannot
declare emitted notifications. Webview, skill, and MCP plugins cannot register because they have
no process. Agent contracts are verified by the backend's agent runtime, not here.

## Storage host methods

`PluginStorage` serves `ora/storage/list`, `read`, `write`, and `remove`, all taking a logical
`path` relative to the plugin's data directory (`""` is the directory itself for `list`):

| Method               | Params                   | Result                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ora/storage/list`   | `{ path }`               | `{ entries: [{ name, kind, size_bytes }] }` |
| `ora/storage/read`   | `{ path }`               | `{ bytes_base64 }`                          |
| `ora/storage/write`  | `{ path, bytes_base64 }` | `{}` (parents created, atomic replace)      |
| `ora/storage/remove` | `{ path }`               | `{}` (file or whole directory tree)         |

`kind` is `file` or `directory`; symlinks and special files are never listed. Paths are parsed
with `ora-utils::path::PortableRelativePath` (no absolute paths, `..`, or NUL), resolved under a
`CanonicalPathRoot`, and must be reached without traversing any symlink; the host-owned
`web-profile/` subtree is refused at the first segment and hidden from root listings. Files are
capped at `MAX_STORAGE_FILE_BYTES` (8 MiB) in both directions because base64 must fit the 16 MiB
frame. Failures are JSON-RPC errors whose `data.kind` is one of `invalid_params` (`-32602`),
`invalid_path` (`-32602`), `not_found` (`-32004`), `too_large` (`-32005`), or `io` (`-32000`);
unknown `ora/storage/*` methods get `-32601`. Filesystem work runs on the blocking pool.

## Data plane

`PluginRuntime` exposes `registration`, `invoke`, and `notify` in addition to stop and exit
observation. `PluginLifecycle::connection` returns a `PluginConnection` pinned to one
`PluginGeneration` (the launch attempt) for a running plugin; `ensure_running` activates a stopped
or failed plugin on demand and waits, bounded, for it to run. Callers hold a connection only for one
interaction so a restarted plugin is never addressed through a stale generation.

Each launch spawns two background tasks guarded by the same attempt: an exit monitor that records
stop or failure, and a notification pump that forwards plugin-originated notifications to the
injected `PluginNotificationSink` as `InboundNotification`s. If the notification stream closes
while the process is still alive past a short grace period, the pump marks the attempt failed
("plugin notification channel closed"); whichever task transitions first wins and the other
observes the attempt mismatch and returns.

## Surface closing

`SurfaceCloser` is installed after construction via `set_surface_closer` because surfaces belong to
the desktop shell, which exists only after the backend is built. Stop and uninstall call
it inside the plugin's operation lock before stopping the runtime, so "uninstall while a surface is
open" needs no coordination beyond that lock. Until a closer is installed, closing is a no-op.

## Boundaries

Filesystem package parsing remains in `ora-plugin-manager`, while process protocol ownership remains
in `ora-plugin-runtime`.
The production adapter launches Deno through the shared process-tree supervisor with the sandbox
permissions the contribution kind requires, and waits for confirmed process exit before filesystem
cleanup. Startup discovery also reports every package that was skipped, because a package that
never became a plugin is otherwise invisible to an operator.

Transport adapters and concrete dependency composition belong to `ora-backend` and Desktop. This
crate does not depend on Tauri, SQLite, or backend-private state.
