//! Tauri-free domain layer for plugin-contributed UI surfaces.
//!
//! The crate owns surface identity, definitions, navigation policy, the open/migrate/close state
//! machine, the process-wide registry, workbench asset URLs, and the webview-plugin download
//! pipeline (intent, rule selection, and the managed-download state machine). Every decision is
//! made here as pure data; the desktop host executes the returned effects against real webviews
//! and the shared safe-landing module.
