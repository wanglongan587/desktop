# ora-fs

`ora-fs` provides read-only, workspace-scoped filesystem primitives shared by Ora runtimes. It deliberately has no HTTP or frontend dependency and returns crate-native errors so transport adapters can choose their own public error and logging policy.

## Guarantees

- `PortableRelativePath` gives wire and configuration paths platform-independent validation and a
  slash-separated identity. It treats both slash styles as separators and rejects parent traversal,
  rooted paths, Windows drive/UNC prefixes, and NUL bytes on every host.
- `CanonicalPathRoot` centralizes canonical root identity, existing-target resolution, absolute
  selection containment, and conversion back to portable relative paths. Workspace and plugin
  callers use the same primitives rather than maintaining local path validators.
- Roots and existing requested paths are canonicalized before containment checks, including static
  symlink escape protection. These path-based checks do not protect against a concurrently replaced
  symlink between validation and use; callers handling actively hostile directories need a
  handle-relative filesystem design.
- File reads are bounded and reject binary or invalid UTF-8 content.
- Search runs through the injected `ora-process` runner, making ripgrep execution replaceable in tests.
- Native watcher events are normalized into workspace-relative changes and can be debounced by the caller.
- The `spec` module discovers Markdown/MDX through the same injected bundled ripgrep, supports explicit ignored sources, and resolves platform-selected directories without allowing workspace escape.

The adapters are documented in [Task Workspace Files](../../docs/task-workspace-files.md) and [Specification management](../../docs/spec-management.md). Tests can inject a `ProcessSpawner` rather than starting ripgrep.
