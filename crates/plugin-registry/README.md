# ora-plugin-registry

`ora-plugin-registry` syncs marketplace source repositories over Git and builds the lightweight
`registry_index.json` that lists available plugins for consumers such as the UI.

## Responsibilities

- `RegistrySync::sync` clones a marketplace source when absent, otherwise fetches, checks out the
  tracked branch, and fast-forwards it against its remote through an injected `gitlancer::Git`;
  the environment held by the source (`RegistrySource::git_env`) is applied to those Git commands.
- `RegistrySource` carries a `gitlancer::GitEnv` set with `with_git_env` and read with `git_env`,
  allowing callers such as the backend to opt individual marketplace checkouts into a network proxy.
- `RegistrySource::from_git` derives a source's checkout directory from its git URL beneath the
  sources root, so several marketplace sources can be synced side by side without a manual
  URL-to-directory mapping.
- `RegistrySource::try_from_git` validates the same source shape as `from_git` but rejects
  non-HTTPS URLs and malformed short branch names before any checkout directory or Git work begins;
  configuration-backed callers use this checked entry point.
- `RegistryIndex::build` recursively scans a directory for `orax.toml` files, parses each valid
  manifest into a `RegistryEntry`, and returns a deterministically ordered index built at an
  injected Unix timestamp.
- `RegistryIndex::build_all` scans several registry directories and merges their entries into one
  index: a shared `namespace/name` id is listed once and the first source in source order wins.
- `RegistryIndex::load` reads a previously written index file; `RegistryIndex::write` replaces the
  target file atomically through `ora-utils` so readers never observe a partial index.
- Each entry carries the manifest's display `title` (falling back to the identifier when the
  manifest or an older cached index omits it), so consumers render a human name without
  re-reading `orax.toml`.
- Each entry's optional `logo.svg`, read from the directory holding its `orax.toml` and accepted by
  `ora-utils::svg`, is inlined into the index so consumers can render the listing from the cached
  index alone. A missing, unreadable, or unsafe icon leaves the entry listed without one.
- A single malformed or unreadable `orax.toml` is skipped, logged as a warning, and reported through
  `RegistryBuild::skipped` without blocking the whole build.

## Non-responsibilities

- Installing, enabling, disabling, or removing plugins.
- Resolving dependency trees or evaluating host version requirements.
- Choosing where source checkouts live under the data directory; callers supply the checkout path.

## Public interface

`RegistryIndex::build(dir, updated_at)` returns a `RegistryBuild` carrying the ordered index and any
skipped manifests; `RegistryIndex::build_all(dirs, updated_at)` does the same across several
source directories. `RegistryIndex::load(path)` / `RegistryIndex::write(path)` read and atomically
persist an index, and `RegistryIndex::resolve_manifest_all(dirs, id)` finds a release manifest
across sources in source order. `RegistrySync::sync(&git, &source)` returns the checkout directory
so callers can then build an index from it.
