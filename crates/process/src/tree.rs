//! Platform-specific process-tree termination for spawned child processes.
//!
//! Tree-wide termination is required because a child (for example a shell) may itself spawn nested
//! processes. Killing only the direct child leaves those descendants orphaned and running. This
//! module owns the OS resources and primitives used to request termination of the entire tree
//! rooted at one spawned child:
//!
//! - On Unix the child is placed in its own process group (set via `Command::process_group(0)`);
//!   the entire group is signalled with `kill(-pgid, SIGKILL)`.
//! - On Windows the child is assigned to a Job Object created with
//!   `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`; the whole job is terminated with
//!   `TerminateJobObject`. Graceful drop disarms the kill-on-close limit first, so only an
//!   ungraceful termination (process crash where `Drop` cannot run) relies on handle-close
//!   cleanup to kill every process still in the job.
//!
//! [`ProcessTree::kill`] mirrors the `start_kill` contract used by [`crate::ManagedProcess::kill`]:
//! it delivers the termination request to the OS and returns without waiting for any process to
//! actually exit. Callers that need the final exit status must still reap the direct child via
//! [`crate::ManagedProcess::wait`].
