# Ora Plugin Manager

`ora-plugin-manager` discovers installed Ora plugin packages from an Ora data directory and
orchestrates checksum-verified installs of new plugin releases.

## Responsibilities

- Scan `<data-dir>/plugins/installed/<namespace>/<name>/<version>`, parse version directory names
  as SemVer, and select only the highest version for each namespace/name pair without falling back
  when that selected package is invalid.
- Read the selected package's `orax.toml` through `ora-plugin-manifest`, which owns the manifest
  schema, and require the manifest version to match the version directory.
- Resolve the fixed `main.js` entrypoint for agent and workbench packages as an existing regular
  file whose canonical target remains inside its package, then retain its portable relative path.
  Webview and skill packages have no process entrypoint.
- Keep `kind` and its contribution in one value (`PluginContribution::Agent`, `::Workbench`,
  `::Webview`, or `::Skill`), so a validated plugin always carries exactly what its kind promises.
  Skill contributions carry no additional contract fields, but the package must contain one or
  more `assets/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` trees. Each Skill manifest is parsed and its declared name
  must match the package directory before it can be cataloged.
- Apply the host's surface policy to `[[ui.surfaces]]`: entry URL scheme and host allow lists
  for remote sites, the on-disk asset directory and entry document for panels, surface count and
  title limits, and id uniqueness, producing typed values (`SurfaceId`, `HostName`, `Url`,
  `PanelSource`) that downstream surface hosts reuse directly.
- Read the package's optional `logo.svg` icon and retain its source text once
  `ora-utils::svg` accepts it. A package without an icon is ordinary; an icon that is present but
  unreadable or unsafe becomes a discovery issue and leaves the plugin itself discovered without one.
- Return a deterministic, immutable snapshot of valid installed plugins keyed by
  `ora_domain::PluginId`.
- Isolate malformed or unsupported packages as structured discovery issues.
- Install a plugin release: download the `.orax` package (through an injected `ora-utils::http`
  `HttpDownload`), verify its SHA-256 while downloading, and safely extract it into
  `<data-dir>/plugins/installed/<namespace>/<name>/<version>` with `ora-utils::archive`.
- Import one local `.orax` release archive by extracting into a disposable staging directory,
  parsing its in-archive `orax.toml`, verifying a declared `sha256`, and then moving only the
  validated tree into `<data-dir>/plugins/installed/<namespace>/<name>/<version>`.

## Non-responsibilities

- Parsing the manifest schema; `ora-plugin-manifest` does that and this crate consumes the result.
- Enabling, disabling, or removing plugins; starting plugin processes or loading plugin JavaScript.
- Evaluating the `[dependencies].ora` requirement.
- Watching the filesystem after discovery completes.

## Public interface

Call `PluginManager::discover(data_dir)` once during application bootstrap. Consumers read the
resulting snapshot through `installed_plugins()` and report any non-fatal problems from
`discovery_issues()`. `installed_root(data_dir)`, `MANIFEST_FILE_NAME`, and
`INSTALLED_ENTRYPOINT` expose the layout to callers that write or inspect it. A local `.orax`
archive is imported with `Installer::install_local(archive_path, data_dir)`, which returns an
`InstalledPackage` carrying the materialized `package_dir` and the `namespace/name` plugin id
derived from the in-archive manifest. `Installer::new` accepts any `HttpDownload`; `install`
returns the package directory it extracted into.

## Validation split

`ora-plugin-manifest` guarantees the shape of a manifest: field types, unknown fields, the id
grammar, enum spellings, that `[ui]` is present exactly for `kind = "ui"`, that every surface has
a slug `id` and a non-empty `title`, and that each `source.kind` carries its own fields. This
crate adds what depends on the host or on the package on disk:

- Agent and workbench packages must contain `main.js`; webview and skill packages do not.
- A skill package must contain `assets/skills/` with at least one immediate Skill directory, and
  every such directory must contain a regular root `SKILL.md`. Optional `scripts/`, `references/`,
  and nested `assets/` contents are preserved but not interpreted in this release.
- `display_name` is the plugin `name` for every kind; a ui plugin's user-visible entries are its
  surface titles. One agent-kind package contributes exactly one agent with no identifier of its
  own: the package's plugin id is that agent's identity everywhere in the host.
- A ui plugin declares at most eight surfaces, each with a package-unique `SurfaceId` (a slug of
  at most 32 bytes), a title of at most 64 characters without control characters, and
  `instances = "singleton"` (`"multiple"` is refused until the host supports it).
- A `remote_site` source is an `https` entry URL without credentials or port whose host must be
  covered by the union of `hosts` and `host_suffixes` (lowercase DNS names; suffixes match on
  label boundaries); at least one allow-list entry is required. `web_data.mode` defaults to
  `persistent`.
- A `panel` source names a `root` subdirectory of the package and an `.html` `entry` below it;
  both must exist at discovery time and resolve canonically inside the package, and the validated
  `PanelSource` carries the canonical asset directory so hosts can serve files under it as a
  containment root without ever exposing `orax.toml` or the plugin source. Panels always get an
  isolated persistent web profile, so declaring `web_data` on a panel is an error.
- Surfaces are returned sorted by id.

Validation failures report a stable `field_path` such as `ui.surfaces[0].source.entry`.
Structural failures (TOML syntax, unknown fields, wrong types, unknown `source.kind`) are
reported as `invalid_toml` with the TOML path of the offending value; semantic failures, from
either crate, as `invalid_manifest`. The `surface` module (`SurfaceId`, `HostName`,
`InstancePolicy`, `WebDataPolicy`) is the single definition of these value types; surface hosts in
other crates reuse it rather than redefining validation.

## Layout rules

Namespace, package, and version directories must be real directories (symlinks are skipped at
every level, because the installer only ever writes real directories) and the manifest inside a
version directory must be a regular file. A version directory that is not valid SemVer is reported
as `invalid_install_path`. The directory names are not part of a package's identity: the manifest
alone names the plugin, and two packages claiming the same `<namespace>/<name>` keep the first in
path order and report the second as `duplicate_plugin_id`. Discovery never recurses below one
version directory and never reads more than 1 MiB from one manifest. The pre-versioned
`<data-dir>/plugins/<package>` layout is not discovered or migrated. Entrypoint containment
rejects the current target of a package-escaping symlink, but path-based validation cannot prevent
a concurrent symlink replacement between discovery and later loading. A missing installed root
represents an empty installation and is not an error.
