/**
 * Resolves which agent CLI a chat surface is currently pointing at.
 *
 * The composer and the model picker each warm a session against this answer, and
 * a warm session's identity includes the CLI — so two call sites that computed it
 * differently would build a second provider session and leave the picker offering
 * models the composer is not pointing at. Owning the whole precedence chain in
 * one place is what keeps them from drifting apart; callers must not re-derive
 * any part of it.
 *
 * A pending switch outranks the session's own binding. The user has chosen to
 * move this conversation, and everything on screen must already describe the
 * agent it is moving to, even though the binding itself does not change until
 * the next message is sent.
 *
 * With no pending move, a persisted session runs on whatever the backend has it
 * bound to, which is not necessarily the stored default — that only decides what
 * the *next* surface opens on. Before a session row exists there is nothing
 * bound, so the pick recorded for this exact target answers instead; reading the
 * shared default directly would let picking an agent for one not-yet-started chat
 * repaint every other one the moment it is visited.
