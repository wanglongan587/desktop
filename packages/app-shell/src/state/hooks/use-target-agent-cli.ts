/**
 * Resolves which agent CLI a chat surface is currently pointing at.
 *
 * The composer and model picker both use this answer for model intent and first send.
 * Owning the whole precedence chain in
 * one place is what keeps them from drifting apart; callers must not re-derive
 * any part of it.
 *
 * A pending switch outranks the session's own binding. The user has chosen to
 * move this conversation, and everything on screen must already describe the
 * agent it is moving to, even though the binding itself does not change until
 * the next message is sent.
 *
 * With no pending move, a persisted session runs on whatever the backend has it
 * bound to, which is not necessarily the stored default — that only decides what
 * the *next* surface opens on. Before a session row exists there is nothing
 * bound, so the pick recorded for this exact target answers instead; reading the
 * shared default directly would let picking an agent for one not-yet-started chat
 * repaint every other one the moment it is visited.
 *
 * A binding or preference is reported as written even when that agent can no
 * longer be reached. Agent availability is allowed to change while a surface is
 * open, and using the first available agent as a fallback would silently change
 * the user's selection when a plugin is installed or removed. A surface that has
 * never chosen an agent therefore resolves to `null` instead of inventing one.
 * Giving a first run something to send on is `useDefaultAgentAdoption`'s job:
 * it writes the shared default once, so what arrives here is always a real
 * preference rather than a guess this resolver would have to make again on
 * every render.
