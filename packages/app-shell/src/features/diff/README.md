# diff

Task Changes panel: parsed worktree patches, file tree, and git commit/push actions.

## Responsibilities

- Render unified/split diffs for a task scope (`branch` / staged / unstaged / commit).
- Collapse distant unchanged context and restore it on demand.
- Scroll a selected file to the viewport top through the single programmatic
  scroll runner (`task-diff-scroll-run.ts`), shared by file-tree clicks and
  chat-link jumps so exactly one run owns the viewport at a time. Because
  off-screen files render as estimated-height placeholders, the run keeps
  re-aligning until the target sits at the top (or the container is clamped
  at its end), holds the scroll spy until then, and hands the viewport back
  the moment the user scrolls (wheel / touch / pointer). A tree click also
  paints a one-second wash over the selected section (`ora-diff-file-flash`),
  so a click that needs no scrolling still reads as acknowledged.
- Jump from chat file links to a new-side line inside the active patch, or
  highlight an inclusive start–end range from a user-authored quote chip.
  Diff quotes pass `{ line, endLine, side }` so a delete range is looked up
  on the old side. A later click outside the highlighted rows dismisses the
  wash until the next jump; collapse/expand buttons do not dismiss.
- Own `TaskChangesNavigationContext` (`task-changes-navigation-context.ts` /
  `task-changes-navigation.tsx`): `openDiff`, `openWorkspaceFile`,
  `openWorkspaceDirectory`, and `openWorkspaceArtifact`, implemented by
  `WorkspaceReviewLayout`. File and diff jumps take an optional
  `FileNavigationLocation` (`{ line, endLine, column, side }`) so callers
  never pass positional `undefined` holes. Both assistant chat links
  (`chat-link/`) and user-authored reference chips
  (`file-ref-chip-navigation.ts`) route through these calls, so the
  Files/Changes highlight visuals stay in one place regardless of who
  authored the reference. User-authored chips only ever use `openDiff` /
  `openWorkspaceFile` / `openWorkspaceDirectory` — they always know their
  own kind, so they never need `openWorkspaceArtifact`'s parent-listing
  resolution.
- Quote visible diff lines into the chat composer via gutter `+` (click) or
  gutter/`+` drag-release. Clicking a line number pins a highlight on that
  side only (shift-click extends within the same side); Ctrl/Cmd+Enter on a
  focused line number quotes the pinned range, which is the keyboard route to
  the `+` (the `+` itself stays out of the tab order so a long file does not
  add one tab stop per line). Split view keeps both columns numbered; only
  unified collapses context rows to a single number. New-side insert/normal
  rows use the new path; pure deletes use the old path. Drag uses min–max line
  fill (including collapsed content, matching Cursor). A visual Diff range
  that crosses delete / insert / context stays **one chip** (basename +
  `L12-14`); add vs delete is only in the agent payload (`+/-/ `). A drag
  that spans collapsed hunks also stays one chip. File-preview gaps still
  split chips. Collapsed blocks stay non-quotable as click targets until
  expanded.
  Plus is a CSS `+` on the button (no per-line SVG). Unified view hosts every
  `+` in the old (left) gutter so delete, insert, and context share one
  vertical track; a drag that starts on a delete continues through inserts
  below (visual row order). Split view keeps each `+` in its own column and
  locks a drag to that side. It shows for
  the whole hovered change (react-diff-view line hover on code or gutter);
  drag starts from the gutter cell or the `+` and paints selection
  imperatively on that side's gutter and code cells so a split view never
  tints the opposite column.
  On send the chip stays basename + `L12-14`, but the agent payload is a mini
  `diff --git` patch (`--- a/` / `+++ b/` / `@@` / unified `+/-/ ` body, with
  a hunk header `quoted from git diff`, plus `(old|new side)` when the chip
  is a single side, and the quoted file lines as `lines 12-14`) so a follow-up
  comment is clearly about the existing git change, not current file contents.
  The line note is what chat history reads back to redraw the same chip label:
  the hunk counts only cover the body, which is shorter than the span whenever
  the drag crossed a collapsed hunk.
- Own commit/push UI for the same task worktree.

## Non-responsibilities

- Composer chip rendering or TipTap document ownership (handoff goes through
  `addComposerFileSelection` → `composer-file-context-store`).
- Workspace file browsing (Files / Specs panels).
- Diff comment threads (removed).
