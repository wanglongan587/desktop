/**
 * The composer's agent and model picker.
 *
 * Both lists describe the session the composer will send into. Which agents exist
 * is whatever this installation can actually reach; which models are available is
 * whatever the chosen agent reported for this session, so the model list has three
 * states rather than two — still arriving, genuinely offering no choice, or a real
 * set to pick from.
 *
 * With a session selected, choosing a different CLI moves that conversation onto
 * it rather than only changing the default for the next one. Ora owns the
 * transcript, so the thread survives the move: the backend hands it to the new
 * agent with the user's next message. The move is *recorded* here and performed
 * by that message — clicking cannot rebind immediately without tearing down an
 * agent that may still be mid-reply. What the click does start is warming the
 * incoming CLI, which is how the models below can be replaced by its own before
 * anything is committed. Choosing a CLI therefore leaves the menu open: picking
 * one of those models is the other half of the same decision.

   * either way the CLI's own models arrive from a handshake that has not
   * happened yet — this only points the surface at it. The list below settles
