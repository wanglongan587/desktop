# composer

Tiptap preset and plain-text helpers for prompt boxes (chat composer, HITL).

## Responsibilities

- Provide `createComposerExtensions()` with the dashboard SimpleEditor WYSIWYG
  model: kit-styled exclusive links, file chips, and inline skill/command
  mentions.
- Convert between Tiptap documents and newline-delimited Markdown-ish plain
  text without HTML parsing (headings 1–6, lists, quotes, fences, marks, chips).
  Typed Markdown uses Tiptap input rules when the closer is typed at the
  caret. After the opener is added in front of existing closers (`**`, `*`, `~~`,
  `==`, backticks, `__`, `_`, `***`), a trailing space or newline re-parses
  **that** still-plain line only — other leftover lines stay source until they
  are confirmed. Converting on the first `*` of `*bold**` would steal
  italic. Backspace against contiguous converted mark runs (not a heading, and
  not plain text typed after the marks) restores their Markdown source so further
  deletes remove real characters. Typing at the start of a converted mark stays
  inside it; typing after it is body text. Pasted Markdown and restored
  `documentPlainText` drafts parse into the same nodes so `#` / `**` /
  `- [ ]` still render as structure. Path-like backticks (slash paths, known
  source extensions, dotfiles) and `$skill` tokens become chips on that text
  path; versions (`v1.0`), globs (`*.ts`), slash-command chips, and directory
  `kind` need TipTap JSON parking (chat composer) for a lossless round-trip.
  File quotes never expand to their body — non-diff quotes serialize to
  `` `path:range` ``, so what the agent reads and what history replays is a
  reference, while the chip keeps its range label. A Diff-gutter quote sets
  `origin: "diff"` and is the one payload that expands to a mini `diff --git`
  patch with unified `+/-/ ` markers. A mixed add/delete range is still one
  chip; `diffSide` is omitted and the body carries `+/-/ `. The patch's hunk
  note names the quoted file lines (`lines 2-40`) because the hunk counts
  describe the body, which is shorter whenever a drag crossed a collapsed
  hunk. `parseComposerFileQuote` is the inverse of the `diff` fence (and of
  legacy `start:end:path` citation fences): read-only surfaces only hold the
  sent text, so it is what lets them rebuild the chip — including its label —
  from the fence alone. Any other fence parses to null and stays a code block.
  Path-only `@` mentions stay backtick paths. Read-only user history also turns
  path-like backtick spans back into chips so a reference is never shown as
  raw code.
  Inline code that contains backticks, and fenced blocks that contain a ` ``` `
  line, serialize with a longer CommonMark fence so parse cannot close early.
  `[label](javascript:…)` / `data:` / `vbscript:` / `file:` hrefs stay literal
  text instead of becoming a link mark. Link titles escape `\` then `"` so a
  quoted title round-trips. Raw strings that must stay literal (`<`
  as text) use `plainTextToComposerContent`. `[ ] ` at the start of a paragraph
  or bullet becomes a task item (not a checklist nested under a disc). Marks
  reuse the kit Bold / Italic / Strike / Code / Highlight / Link / Underline
  extensions. Kit input rules require a leading ASCII space, which misses
  `你好**等等**`; composer keeps `markInputRule` and only relaxes flanking so
  CJK can sit against `*` / `**` / `***` / `~~` / `==`. Underline is Mod-u
  (Markdown has no `__underline__` syntax; `__` is bold). `documentPlainText`
  therefore drops underline; park TipTap JSON to keep it across session switches.
- Shift+Enter is always a newline inside the current structure (code, quote,
  list, heading). Enter leaves that structure and returns to body text, or
  sends from a body paragraph. An empty heading or list item is empty only
  when it has no chips (content size, not `textContent`). Shift+Enter on an
  empty quote lifts the quote instead of inserting another paragraph inside it.
  A trailing space after a fence info string also
  opens the fence.
- Custom commands (`insertComposerFiles`, `setPromptToken`) compose through the
  `commands.*` given to them so every step lands on the one transaction TipTap
  opened for the call. A nested `editor.chain()…run()` inside a command commits
  a second transaction while the outer one is still open; the outer transaction
  is then applied to a state it was never built from and ProseMirror throws
  `Applying a mismatched transaction` _after_ the content has already been
  inserted. `insertComposerFiles` needs two steps whenever a quote lands right
  behind an existing chip or token — it drops the separator space first so a
  range selection cannot paint a caret-thin bar between adjacent atoms.
- Prompt links open on pointerdown (not mouseup/`click`) so the first press
  leaves the editor instead of placing a caret. Desktop still routes through
  the host browser command; this preset only calls `window.open` when no
  platform adapter intercepts the event.

## Capability minimum set

`COMPOSER_CAPABILITIES` is the supported surface. Anything else in the full-page
kit (images, TOC, video, alignment) is out of scope.

| Layer  | Nodes / marks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Chips  | `composerFile` (chip), `promptToken` (mention); drag-select snaps onto the chip under the pointer and paints `data-chip-selected` without a React re-render; ArrowLeft/ArrowRight step the caret across a chip instead of node-selecting it; click-to-select pins a TextSelection over the atom so the caret stays visible and the same wash paints. A plain click on a mention pins that same range (mentions render as bare spans with no host click handler); a plain click on a file chip stays consumed so the host node view decides, and shift-click never re-pins so a drag-built range survives |

Replace a slot with `features: { link: false }` or `features: { link: MyLink }`
and append extras via `extraExtensions`. Rendering stays CSS in the product shell
so the preset does not pull dashboard `--tt-*` SCSS.

## GFM subset

Typed and pasted inline marks follow GitHub Flavored Markdown flanking: the
opener is not followed by a space, the closer is not preceded by a space, and
`_` does not fire inside `snake_case`. `==highlight==` drops the delimiters and
renders as Typora-style yellow (`<mark>`). `***bold-italic***` applies both
marks. Adjacent `**bold***em*` / `*em***bold**` share the middle `***` (bold
close plus italic open, or the reverse). A line that is only `***` is still a
rule. Nested `>` quotes and lists
inside a quote parse on paste. `[label](url "title")` keeps the title.
Mod-u underline is a product extra, not GFM.

Out of this subset on purpose: tables, images, footnotes, HTML blocks, nested
list indent on paste (Tab still nests while typing), and setext headings.

## Non-responsibilities

- Product keymap (Enter to send), attachments, `@` / `/` menus, theming.
- Full-page document chrome (TOC, images, diffs).
- CommonMark extras the prompt box does not own: tables, images, footnotes,
  HTML blocks.
- Dashboard `--tt-*` SCSS; prompt surfaces style against Ora tokens instead.
